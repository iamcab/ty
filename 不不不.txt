About the Author
Richard Osman is a British television producer and presenter
 The Thursday Murder Club is his first and
 so far
 best novel
To my mum
 ‘the last surviving Brenda’
 with love
Killing someone is easy
 Hiding the body
 now that’s usually the hard part
 That’s how you get caught
I was lucky enough to stumble upon the right place
 though
 The perfect place
 really
I come back from time to time
 just to make sure everything is still safe and sound
 It always is
 and I suppose it always will be
Sometimes I’ll have a cigarette
 which I know I shouldn’t
 but it’s my only vice
Part One

MEET NEW PEOPLE AND TRY NEW THINGS
1
Joyce
Well
 let’s start with Elizabeth
 shall we
 And see where that gets us
I knew who she was
 of course
 everybody here knows Elizabeth
 She has one of the three-bed flats in Larkin Court
 It’s the one on the corner
 with the decking
 Also
 I was once on a quiz team with Stephen
 who
 for a number of reasons
 is Elizabeth’s third husband
I was at lunch
 this is two or three months ago
 and it must have been a Monday
 because it was shepherd’s pie
 Elizabeth said she could see that I was eating
 but wanted to ask me a question about knife wounds
 if it wasn’t inconvenient
I said
 ‘Not at all
 of course
 please
’ or words to that effect
 I won’t always remember everything exactly
 I might as well tell you that now
 So she opened a manila folder
 and I saw some typed sheets and the edges of what looked like old photographs
 Then she was straight into it
Elizabeth asked me to imagine that a girl had been stabbed with a knife
 I asked what sort of knife she had been stabbed with
 and Elizabeth said probably just a normal kitchen knife
 John Lewis
 She didn’t say that
 but that was what I pictured
 Then she asked me to imagine this girl had been stabbed
 three or four times
 just under the breastbone
 In and out
 in and out
 very nasty
 but without severing an artery
 She was fairly quiet about the whole thing
 because people were eating
 and she does have some boundaries
So there I was
 imagining stab wounds
 and Elizabeth asked me how long it would take the girl to bleed to death
By the way
 I realize I should have mentioned that I was a nurse for many years
 otherwise none of this will make sense to you
 Elizabeth would have known that from somewhere
 because Elizabeth knows everything
 Anyway
 that’s why she was asking me
 You must have wondered what I was on about
 I will get the hang of writing this
 I promise
I remember dabbing at my mouth before I answered
 like you see on television sometimes
 It makes you look cleverer
 try it
 I asked what the girl had weighed
Elizabeth found the information in her folder
 followed her finger and read out that the girl had been forty-six kilos
 Which threw us both
 because neither of us was sure what forty-six kilos was in real money
 In my head I was thinking it must be about twenty-three stone
 Two to one was my thinking
 Even as I thought that
 though
 I suspected I was getting mixed up with inches and centimetres
Elizabeth let me know the girl definitely wasn’t twenty-three stone
 as she had a picture of her corpse in the folder
 She tapped the folder at me
 before turning her attention back to the room
 and said
 ‘Will somebody ask Bernard what forty-six kilos is
’
Bernard always sits by himself
 on one of the smaller tables nearest the patio
 It is Table 8
 You don’t need to know that
 but I will tell you a bit about Bernard
Bernard Cottle was very kind to me when I first arrived at Coopers Chase
 He brought me a clematis cutting and explained the recycling timetable
 They have four different coloured bins here
 Four! Thanks to Bernard
 I know that green is for glass
 and blue is cardboard and paper
 As for red and black
 though
 your guess is still as good as mine
 I’ve seen all sorts as I’ve wandered about
 Someone once put a fax machine in one
Bernard had been a professor
 something in science
 and had worked all around the world
 including going to Dubai before anyone had heard of it
 True to form
 he was wearing a suit and tie to lunch
 but was
 nevertheless
 reading the Daily Express
 Mary from Ruskin Court
 who was at the next table
 got his attention and asked how much forty-six kilos was when it was at home
Bernard nodded and called over to Elizabeth
 ‘Seven stone three and a bit
’
And that’s Bernard for you
Elizabeth thanked him and said that sounded about right
 and Bernard returned to his crossword
 I looked up centimetres and inches afterwards
 and at least I was right about that
Elizabeth went back to her question
 How long would the girl stabbed with the kitchen knife have to live
 I guessed that
 unattended
 she would probably die in around forty-five minutes
‘Well
 quite
 Joyce
’ she said
 and then had another question
 What if the girl had had medical assistance
 Not a doctor
 but someone who could patch up a wound
 Someone who’d been in the army
 perhaps
 Someone like that
I have seen a lot of stab wounds in my time
 My job wasn’t all sprained ankles
 So I said then
 well
 she wouldn’t die at all
 Which she wouldn’t
 It wouldn’t have been fun for her
 but it would have been easy to patch up
Elizabeth was nodding away
 and said that was precisely what she had told Ibrahim
 although I didn’t know Ibrahim at that time
 As I say
 this was a couple of months ago
It hadn’t seemed at all right to Elizabeth
 and her view was that the boyfriend had killed her
 I know this is still often the case
 You read about it
I think before I moved in I might have found this whole conversation unusual
 but it is pretty par for the course once you get to know everyone here
 Last week I met the man who invented Mint Choc Chip ice cream
 or so he tells it
 I don’t really have any way of checking
I was glad to have helped Elizabeth in my small way
 so decided I might ask a favour
 I asked if there was any way I could take a look at the picture of the corpse
 Just out of professional interest
Elizabeth beamed
 the way people around here beam when you ask to look at pictures of their grandchildren graduating
 She slipped an A4 photocopy out of her folder
 laid it
 face down
 in front of me and told me to keep it
 as they all had copies
I told her that was very kind of her
 and she said not at all
 but she wondered if she could ask me one final question
‘Of course
’ I said
Then she said
 ‘Are you ever free on Thursdays
’
And
 that
 believe it or not
 was the first I had heard of Thursdays

PC Donna De Freitas would like to have a gun
 She would like to be chasing serial killers into abandoned warehouses
 grimly getting the job done
 despite a fresh bullet wound in her shoulder
 Perhaps developing a taste for whisky and having an affair with her partner
But for now
 twenty-six years old
 and sitting down for lunch at 11
45 in the morning
 with four pensioners she has only just met
 Donna understands that she will have to work her way up to all that
 And besides
 she has to admit that the last hour or so has been rather fun
Donna has given her talk ‘Practical Tips for Home Security’ many times
 And today there was the usual audience of older people
 blankets across knees
 free biscuits
 and a few happy snoozers at the back
 She gives the same advice each time
 The absolute
 paramount importance of installing window locks
 checking ID cards and never giving out personal information to cold callers
 More than anything
 she is supposed to be a reassuring presence in a terrifying world
 Donna understands that
 and it also gets her out of both the station and paperwork
 so she volunteers
 Fairhaven Police Station is sleepier than Donna is used to
Today
 however
 she had found herself at Coopers Chase Retirement Village
 It seemed innocuous enough
 Lush
 untroubled
 sedate
 and on her drive in she had spotted a nice pub for lunch on the way home
 So getting serial killers in headlocks on speedboats would have to wait
‘Security
’ Donna had begun
 though she was really thinking about whether she should get a tattoo
 A dolphin on her lower back
 Or would that be too much of a cliché
 And would it be painful
 Probably
 but she was supposed to be a police officer
 wasn’t she
 ‘What do we mean when we say the word “security”
 Well
 I think that word means different things to different …’
A hand shot up in the front row
 Which was not normally how this went
 but in for a penny
 An immaculately dressed woman in her eighties had a point to make
‘Dear
 I think we’re all hoping this won’t be a talk about window locks
’ The woman looked around her
 picking up murmured support
A gentleman hemmed in by a walking frame in the second row was next
 ‘And no ID cards please
 we know about ID cards
 Are you really from the Gas Board
 or are you a burglar
 We’ve got it
 I promise
’
A free-for-all had commenced
‘It’s not the Gas Board any more
 It’s Centrica
’ said a man in a very good three-piece suit
The man sitting next to him
 wearing shorts
 flip-flops and a West Ham United shirt
 took this opportunity to stand up and stab a finger in no particular direction
 ‘It’s thanks to Thatcher that
 Ibrahim
 We used to own it
’
‘Oh do sit down
 Ron
’ the smartly dressed woman had said
 Then looked at Donna and added
 ‘Sorry about Ron
’ with a slow shake of her head
 The comments had continued to fly
‘And what criminal wouldn’t be able to forge an ID document
’
‘I’ve got cataracts
 You could show me a library card and I’d let you in
’
‘They don’t even check the meter now
 It’s all on the web
’
‘It’s on the cloud
 dear
’
‘I’d welcome a burglar
 It would be nice to have a visitor
’
There had been the briefest of lulls
 An atonal symphony of whistles began as some hearing aids were turned up
 while others were switched off
 The woman in the front row had taken charge again
‘So … and I’m Elizabeth
 by the way … no window locks
 please
 and no ID cards
 and no need to tell us we mustn’t give our PIN number to Nigerians over the phone
 If I am still allowed to say Nigerians
’
Donna De Freitas had regrouped
 but was aware she was no longer thinking about pub lunches or tattoos – now she was thinking about a riot training course back in the good
 old days in south London
‘Well
 what shall we talk about then
’ Donna had asked
 ‘I have to do at least forty-five minutes or I don’t get the time off in lieu
’
‘Institutional sexism in the police force
’ said Elizabeth
‘I’d like to talk about the illegal shooting of Mark Duggan
 sanctioned by the state and –’
‘Sit down
 Ron!’
So it went on
 enjoyably and agreeably
 until the hour was up
 whereupon Donna had been warmly thanked
 shown pictures of grandchildren and then invited to stay for lunch
And so here she is
 picking at her salad
 in what the menu describes as a ‘contemporary upscale restaurant’
 A quarter to twelve is a little early for her to have lunch
 but it wouldn’t have been polite to refuse the invitation
 She notes that her four hosts are not only tucking in to full lunches
 but have also cracked open a bottle of red wine
‘That really was wonderful
 Donna’
 says Elizabeth
 ‘We enjoyed it tremendously
’ Elizabeth looks to Donna like the sort of teacher who terrifies you all year but then gets you a grade A and cries when you leave
 Perhaps it’s the tweed jacket
‘It was blinding
 Donna
’ says Ron
 ‘Can I call you Donna
 love
’
‘You can call me Donna
 but maybe don’t call me love
’ says Donna
‘Quite right
 darling
’ agrees Ron
 ‘Noted
 That story about the Ukrainian with the parking ticket and the chainsaw
 though
 You should do after-dinner speaking
 there’s money in it
 I know someone
 if you’d like a number
’
The salad is delicious
 thinks Donna
 and it’s not often she thinks that
‘I would have made a terrific heroin smuggler
 I think
’ This was Ibrahim
 who had earlier raised the point about Centrica
 ‘It’s just logistics
 isn’t it
 There’s all the weighing too
 which I would enjoy
 very precise
 And they have machines to count money
 All the mod cons
 Have you ever captured a heroin dealer
 PC De Freitas
’
‘No
’ admits Donna
 ‘It’s on my list
 though
’
‘But I’m right that they have machines to count money
’ asks Ibrahim
‘They do
 yes
’ says Donna
‘Wonderful
’ says Ibrahim
 and downs his glass of wine
‘We bore easily
’ adds Elizabeth
 also polishing off a glass
 ‘God save us from window locks
 WPC De Freitas
’
‘It’s just PC now
’ says Donna
‘I see
’ says Elizabeth
 lips pursing
 ‘And what happens if I still choose to say WPC
 Will there be a warrant for my arrest
’
‘No
 but I’ll think a bit less of you
’ says Donna
 ‘Because it’s a really simple thing to do
 and it’s more respectful to me
’
‘Damn! Checkmate
 OK
’ says Elizabeth
 and unpurses her lips
‘Thank you
’ says Donna
‘Guess how old I am
’ challenges Ibrahim
Donna hesitates
 Ibrahim has a nice suit
 and he has great skin
 He smells wonderful
 A handkerchief is artfully folded in his breast pocket
 Hair thinning
 but still there
 No paunch
 and just the one chin
 And yet underneath it all
 Hmmm
 Donna looks at Ibrahim’s hands
 Always the giveaway
‘Eighty
’ she ventures
She sees the wind depart Ibrahim’s sails
 ‘Yes
 spot on
 but I look younger
 I look about seventy-four
 Everyone agrees
 The secret is Pilates
’
‘And what’s your story
 Joyce
’ asks Donna to the fourth member of the group
 a small
 white-haired woman in a lavender blouse and mauve cardigan
 She is sitting very happily
 taking it all in
 Mouth closed
 but eyes bright
 Like a quiet bird
 constantly on the lookout for something sparkling in the sunshine
‘Me
’ says Joyce
 ‘No story at all
 I was a nurse
 and then a mum
 and then a nurse again
 Nothing to see here I’m afraid
’
Elizabeth gives a short snort
 ‘Don’t be taken in by Joyce
 PC De Freitas
 She is the type who “gets things done”
’
‘I’m just organized
’ says Joyce
 ‘It’s out of fashion
 If I say I’m going to Zumba
 I go to Zumba
 That’s just me
 My daughter is the interesting one in the family
 She runs a hedge fund
 if you know what one is
’
‘Not really
’ admits Donna
‘No
’ agrees Joyce
‘Zumba is before Pilates
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘I don’t like to do both
 It’s counter-intuitive to your major muscle groups
’
A question has been nagging at Donna throughout lunch
 ‘So
 if you don’t mind me asking
 I know you all live at Coopers Chase
 but how did the four of you become friends
’
‘Friends
’ Elizabeth seems amused
 ‘Oh
 we’re not friends
 dear
’
Ron is chuckling
 ‘Christ
 love
 no
 we’re not friends
 Do you need a top-up
 Liz
’
Elizabeth nods and Ron pours
 They are on a second bottle
 It is 12
15
Ibrahim agrees
 ‘I don’t think friends is the word
 We wouldn’t choose to socialize
 we have very different interests
 I like Ron
 I suppose
 but he can be very difficult
’
Ron nods
 ‘I’m very difficult
’
‘And Elizabeth’s manner is off-putting
’
Elizabeth nods
 ‘There it is I’m afraid
 I’ve always been an acquired taste
 Since school
’
‘I like Joyce
 I suppose
 I think we all like Joyce
’ says Ibrahim
Ron and Elizabeth nod their agreement again
‘Thank you
 I’m sure
’ says Joyce
 chasing peas around her plate
 ‘Don’t you think someone should invent flat peas
’
Donna tries to clear up her confusion
‘So if you aren’t friends
 then what are you
’
Donna sees Joyce look up and shake her head at the others
 this unlikely gang
 ‘Well
’ says Joyce
 ‘Firstly
 we are friends
 of course
 this lot are just a little slow catching on
 And secondly
 if it didn’t say on your invitation
 PC De Freitas
 then it was my oversight
 We’re the Thursday Murder Club
’
Elizabeth is going glassy-eyed with red wine
 Ron is scratching at a ‘West Ham’ tattoo on his neck and Ibrahim is polishing an already-polished cufflink
The restaurant is filling up around them
 and Donna is not the first visitor to Coopers Chase to think this wouldn’t be the worst place to live
 She would kill for a glass of wine and an afternoon off
‘Also
 I swim every day
’ concludes Ibrahim
 ‘It keeps the skin tight
’
What is this place
3
If you are ever minded to take the A21 out of Fairhaven
 and head into the heart of the Kentish Weald
 you will eventually pass an old phone box
 still working
 on a sharp left-hand bend
 Continue for around a hundred yards until you see the sign for ‘Whitechurch
 Abbots Hatch and Lents Hill’
 and then take a right
 Head through Lents Hill
 past the Blue Dragon and the little farm shop with the big egg outside
 until you reach the small stone bridge over the Robertsmere
 Officially the Robertsmere is a river
 but don’t get confused and expect anything grand
Take the single-track right turn just past the bridge
 You will think you are headed the wrong way
 but this is quicker than the way the official brochure takes you
 and also picturesque if you like dappled hedgerows
 Eventually the road widens out and
 peeking between tall trees
 you will begin to see signs of life rising on the hilly land up to your left
 Up ahead you will see a tiny
 wood-clad bus stop
 also still working
 if one bus in either direction a day counts as working
 Just before you reach the bus stop you will see the entrance sign for Coopers Chase on your left
They began work on Coopers Chase about ten years ago
 when the Catholic Church sold the land
 The first residents
 Ron
 for one
 had moved in three years later
 It was billed as ‘Britain’s First Luxury Retirement Village’
 though according to Ibrahim
 who has checked
 it was actually the seventh
 There are currently around 300 residents
 You can’t move here until you’re over sixty-five
 and the Waitrose delivery vans clink with wine and repeat prescriptions every time they pass over the cattle grid
The old convent dominates Coopers Chase
 with three modern residential developments spiralling out from this central point
 For over a hundred years the convent was a hushed building
 filled with the dry bustle of habits and the quiet certainty of prayers offered and answered
 Tapping along its dark corridors you would have found some women comfortable in their serenity
 some women frightened of a speeding world
 some women hiding
 some women proving a vague
 long-forgotten point and some women taking joy in serving a higher purpose
 You would have found single beds
 arranged in dorms
 long
 low tables for eating
 a chapel so dark and quiet you would swear you heard God breathing
 In short
 you would find the Sisters of the Holy Church
 an army which would never give you up
 which would feed you and clothe you and continue to need and value you
 All it required in return was a lifetime of devotion
 and
 given there will always be someone requiring that
 there were always volunteers
 And then one day you would take the short trip up the hill
 through the tunnel of trees
 to the Garden of Eternal Rest – the iron gates and low stone walls of the Garden looking over the convent and the endless beauty of the Kentish High Weald beyond
 your body in another single bed
 under a simple stone
 alongside the Sister Margarets and Sister Marys of the generations before you
 If you had once had dreams they could now play over the green hills
 and if you had secrets then they were kept safe inside the four walls of the convent for ever
Well
 more accurately
 three walls
 as the west-facing side of the convent is now entirely glazed to accommodate the residents’ swimming-pool complex
 It looks out over the bowling green
 and then further down to the visitors’ car park
 the permits for which are rationed to such an extent that the Parking Committee is the single most powerful cabal within Coopers Chase
Beside the swimming pool is a small ‘arthritis therapy pool’
 which looks like a Jacuzzi
 largely for the reason that it is a Jacuzzi
 Anyone given the grand tour by the owner
 Ian Ventham
 would then be shown the sauna
 Ian would always open the door a crack and say
 ‘Blimey
 it’s like a sauna in there
’ That was Ian
Take the lift up to the recreation rooms next
 The gym
 and the exercise studio
 where residents could happily Zumba among the ghosts of the single beds
 Then there’s the Jigsaw Room for gentler activities and associations
 There’s the library
 and the lounge for the bigger and more controversial committee meetings
 or for football on the flat-screen TV
 Then down again to the ground floor
 where the long low tables of the convent refectory are now the ‘contemporary upscale restaurant’
At the very heart of the village
 attached to the convent
 is the original chapel
 Its pale cream stucco exterior makes it look almost Mediterranean against the fierce
 Gothic darkness of the convent
 The chapel remains intact and unchanged
 one of the few covenants insisted upon by the executors of the Sisters of the Holy Church when they had sold out ten years ago
 The residents like to use the chapel
 This is where the ghosts are
 where the habits still bustle and where the whispers have sunk into the stone
 It is a place to make you feel part of something slower and something gentler
 Ian Ventham is looking into contractual loopholes that might allow him to redevelop the chapel into eight more flats
Attached to the other side of the convent – the very reason for the convent – is Willows
 Willows is now the nursing home for the village
 It had been established by the Sisters in 1841 as a voluntary hospital
 charitably tending to the sick and broken when no other option existed
 In the latter part of the last century it had become a care home
 until legislation in the 1980s led to the doors finally closing
 The convent then simply became a waiting room
 and when the last nun passed away in 2005
 the Church wasted no time in cashing in and selling it as a job lot
The development sits in twelve acres of woodland and beautiful open hillside
 There are two small lakes
 one real
 and one created by Ian Ventham’s builder
 Tony Curran
 and his gang
 The many ducks and geese that also call Coopers Chase home seem to much prefer the artificial one
 There are still sheep farmed at the very top of the hill
 where the woodland breaks
 and in the pastures by the lake is a herd of twenty llamas
 Ian Ventham had bought two to look quirky in sales photos and it had got out of hand
 as these things do
That
 in a nutshell
 is what this place is

Joyce
I first kept a diary many years ago
 but I’ve looked back at it
 and I don’t think it would be of any interest to you
 Unless you’re interested in Haywards Heath in the 1970s
 which I am going to assume you’re not
 That is no offence to either Haywards Heath or the 1970s
 both of which I enjoyed at the time
But a couple of days ago
 after meeting Elizabeth
 I went to my first ever meeting of the Thursday Murder Club
 and I have been thinking that perhaps it might be interesting to write about
 Like whoever wrote that diary about Holmes and Watson
 People love a murder
 whatever they might say in public
 so I will give it a go
I knew the Thursday Murder Club was going to be Elizabeth
 Ibrahim Arif
 who lives in Wordsworth
 with a wraparound balcony
 and Ron Ritchie
 Yes
 that Ron Ritchie
 So that was something else exciting
 Now I know him a bit better
 the shine has worn off a little
 but even so
Penny Gray also used to be part of it
 but she is now in Willows
 that’s the nursing home
 Thinking about it now
 I fitted right in
 I suppose there had been a vacancy
 and I was the new Penny
I was nervous at the time
 though
 I remember that
 I took along a nice bottle of wine (£8
99
 to give you an idea)
 and as I walked in
 the three of them were already there in the Jigsaw Room
 laying out photographs on the table
Elizabeth had formed the Thursday Murder Club with Penny
 Penny had been an inspector in the Kent Police for many years
 and she would bring along the files of unsolved murder cases
 She wasn’t really supposed to have the files
 but who was to know
 After a certain age
 you can pretty much do whatever takes your fancy
 No one tells you off
 except for your doctors and your children
I’m not supposed to say what Elizabeth used to do for a living
 even though she does go on about it herself at times
 Suffice to say though
 that murders and investigations and what have you wouldn’t be unfamiliar work for her
Elizabeth and Penny would go through every file
 line by line
 study every photograph
 read every witness statement
 just looking for anything that had been missed
 They didn’t like to think there were guilty people still happily going about their business
 Sitting in their gardens
 doing a sudoku
 knowing they had got away with murder
Also
 I think that Penny and Elizabeth just thoroughly enjoyed it
 A few glasses of wine and a mystery
 Very social
 but also gory
 It is good fun
They would meet every Thursday (that’s how they came up with the name)
 It was Thursday because there was a two-hour slot free in the Jigsaw Room
 between Art History and Conversational French
 It was booked
 and still is booked
 under the name Japanese Opera – A Discussion
 which ensured they were always left in peace
There were certain favours both of them could call upon
 for different reasons
 and all sorts of people had been called in for a friendly chat over the years
 Forensics officers
 accountants and judges
 tree surgeons
 horse-breeders
 glass-blowers – they’d all been to the Jigsaw Room
 Whomever Elizabeth and Penny thought might help them with some query or other
Ibrahim had soon joined them
 He used to play bridge with Penny
 and had helped them out once or twice with bits and bobs
 He’s a psychiatrist
 Or was a psychiatrist
 Or still is
 I’m not quite sure
 When you first meet him you can’t see that at all
 but once you get to know him it makes a sort of sense
 I would never have therapy
 because who wants to unravel all that knitting
 Not worth the risk
 thank you
 My daughter
 Joanna
 has a therapist
 although you’d be hard pushed to know why if you saw the size of her house
 Either way
 Ibrahim no longer plays bridge
 which I think is a shame
Ron had all but invited himself
 which won’t surprise you
 He wasn’t buying Japanese Opera for a second and walked into the Jigsaw Room one Thursday
 wanting to know what was afoot
 Elizabeth admires suspicion above all else and invited Ron to flick through the file of a scoutmaster found burned to death in 1982
 in woodland just off the A27
 She soon spotted Ron’s key strength
 namely
 he never believes a single word anyone ever tells him
 Elizabeth now says that reading police files in the certain knowledge that the police are lying to you is surprisingly effective
It is called the Jigsaw Room
 by the way
 because this is where the bigger jigsaws are completed
 on a gently sloping wooden table in the centre of the room
 When I first walked in
 there was a 2
000-piecer of Whitstable harbour
 missing a letterbox of sky
 I once went to Whitstable
 just for the day
 but I couldn’t really see what the fuss was all about
 Once you’ve done the oysters
 there’s no real shopping to speak of
Anyway
 Ibrahim had put a thick perspex screen over the jigsaw
 and this is where he
 Elizabeth and Ron were laying out the autopsy photos of the poor girl
 The one who Elizabeth thought had been killed by her boyfriend
 This particular boyfriend was bitter at being invalided out from the army
 but there’s always something
 isn’t there
 We all have a sob story
 but we don’t all go around killing people
Elizabeth told me to shut the door behind me and come and take a look at some pictures
Ibrahim introduced himself
 shook my hand and told me there were biscuits
 He explained that there were two layers
 but they tried to finish the top layer before they started the bottom layer
 I told him he was preaching to the converted there
Ron took my wine and put it by the biscuits
 He nodded at the label and commented that it was a white
 He then gave me a kiss on the cheek
 which gave me pause for thought
I know you might think that a kiss on the cheek is normal
 but from men in their seventies it isn’t
 The only men who kiss you on the cheek are sons-in-law or people like that
 So I had Ron down as a quick worker straight away
I found out that the famous trade union leader Ron Ritchie lived in the village when he and Penny’s husband
 John
 nursed an injured fox back to health and called it Scargill
 The story had featured in the village newsletter when I first arrived
 Given that John had been a vet and Ron was
 well
 Ron
 I suspected that John had done the nursing and Ron had simply been on naming duties
The newsletter
 by the way
 is called Cut to the Chase
 which is a pun
We all crowded around the autopsy photos
 The poor girl
 and that wound that should never have killed her
 even back in those days
 The boyfriend had bolted from Penny’s squad car on the way to a police interview and hadn’t been seen since
 He had given Penny a belt for her troubles too
 No surprises there
 If you hit women
 you hit women
Even if he hadn’t run off
 I suppose he would have got away with it
 I know you still read about these things all the time
 but it was even worse back then
The Thursday Murder Club wasn’t about to magically bring him to justice
 I think everyone knew that
 Penny and Elizabeth had solved all sorts of cases to their own satisfaction
 but that was as far as they could go
So I suppose you could say that Penny and Elizabeth never really got their wish
 All those murderers remained unpunished
 all still out there
 listening to the shipping forecast somewhere
 They had got away with it
 as some people do
 I’m afraid
 The older you get
 the more you have to come to terms with that
Anyway
 that’s just me being philosophical
 which will get us nowhere
Last Thursday was the first time it was the four of us
 Elizabeth
 Ibrahim
 Ron and me
 And
 as I say
 it seemed very natural
 As if I was completing their jigsaw again
I will leave the diary there for now
 There is a big meeting in the village tomorrow
 I help to put the chairs out for these sorts of things
 I volunteer
 because (a) it makes me look helpful and (b) it gives me first dibs at the refreshments
The meeting is a consultation about a new development at Coopers Chase
 Ian Ventham
 the big boss
 is coming to talk to us about it
 I try to be honest where I can
 so I hope you don’t mind me saying I don’t like him
 He’s all the things that can go wrong with a man if you leave him to his own devices
There has been a fearsome hoo-ha about the new development
 because they’re chopping down trees and uprooting a graveyard
 and there’s a rumour of wind turbines
 Ron is looking forward to causing a bit of trouble
 and I am looking forward to watching him do that
From now on I promise to try to write something every day
 I will keep my fingers crossed that something happens
5
The Waitrose in Tunbridge Wells has a café
 Ian Ventham parks his Range Rover in the last empty disabled bay outside
 not because he’s disabled but because it’s nearest to the door
Walking in
 he spots Bogdan by the window
 Ian owes Bogdan £4
000
 He has been stalling for a while
 in the hope that Bogdan is thrown out of the country
 but thus far
 no luck
 Anyway
 he now has a real job for him
 so it’s all worked out OK
 He gives the Pole a wave and approaches the counter
 He scans the chalkboard
 looking for a coffee
‘Is all your coffee fair trade
’
‘Yes
 all fair trade
’ smiles the young woman serving
‘Shame
’ says Ian
 He doesn’t want to pay an extra fifteen pence to help someone he’ll never meet in a country he’ll never go to
 ‘Cup of tea please
 Almond milk
’
Bogdan isn’t Ian’s biggest worry that day
 If he ends up having to pay him
 then so be it
 Ian’s biggest worry is being killed by Tony Curran
Ian takes his tea over to the table
 spotting anyone over sixty as he goes
 Over sixty
 and with Waitrose money
 Give them ten years
 he thinks
 He wishes he’d brought some brochures
Ian will deal with Tony Curran as and when
 but right now he has to deal with Bogdan
 The good news is that Bogdan doesn’t want to kill him
 Ian sits down
‘What’s all this about two grand
 Bogdan
’ Ian asks
Bogdan is drinking from a two-litre bottle of Lilt he has smuggled in
 ‘Four thousand
 Is pretty cheap to retile a swimming pool
 I don’t know if you know that
’
‘Only cheap if you do a good job
 Bogdan
’ says Ian
 ‘The grouting’s discoloured
 Look
 I asked for coral white
’
Ian takes out his phone
 scrolls through to a photo of his new pool and shows it to Bogdan
‘No
 that is filter
 let’s take off filter
’ Bogdan presses a button and the image immediately brightens
 ‘Coral white
 You know it
’
Ian nods
 Worth a try though
 Sometimes you have to know when to pay up
Ian takes an envelope out of his pocket
 ‘All right
 Bogdan
 fair’s fair
 Here’s three grand
 That do you
’
Bogdan looks weary
 ‘Three grand
 sure
’
Ian hands it over ‘It’s actually two thousand eight hundred
 but that’s near enough between friends
 Now
 I wanted to ask you about something
’
‘Sure
’ says Bogdan
 pocketing the money
‘You seem a bright lad
 Bogdan
’
Bogdan shrugs
 ‘Well
 I speak fluent Polish
’
‘Whenever I ask you to do something
 it gets done
 and it gets done pretty well
 and pretty cheap
’ says Ian
‘Thank you
’ says Bogdan
‘So I’m just wondering
 You ready for something bigger
 you think
’
‘Sure
’ says Bogdan
‘A lot bigger
 though
’ says Ian
‘Sure
’ says Bogdan
 ‘Big is the same as small
 There’s just more of it
’
‘Good lad
’ says Ian
 and drains the last of his tea
 ‘I’m on my way to fire Tony Curran
 And I need someone to step up and take his place
 You fancy that
’
Bogdan gives a low whistle
‘Too much for you
’ asks Ian
Bogdan shakes his head
 ‘No
 not too much for me
 I can do the job
 I just think that if you fire Tony
 maybe he kills you
’
Ian nods
 ‘I know
 But you let me worry about that
 And tomorrow the job’s all yours
’
‘If you’re alive
 sure
’ says Bogdan
Time to go
 Ian shakes Bogdan’s hand and turns his mind to telling Tony Curran the bad news
There’s a consultation meeting down at Coopers Chase
 and he has to listen to what all the old people have to say
 Nod politely
 wear a tie
 call them by their first names
 People lap that sort of thing up
 He’s invited Tony along
 so he can fire him straight afterwards
 Out in the open air
 with witnesses nearby
There is a ten per cent chance that Tony will kill him on the spot
 But that means there is a ninety per cent chance that he won’t
 and
 given how much money it will make Ian
 he is comfortable with those odds
 Risk and reward
As Ian gets outside
 he hears beeping and sees a woman on a mobility scooter furiously pointing at his Range Rover with a cane
I was there first
 love
 thinks Ian
 as he steps into the car
 What is wrong with some people
As he drives
 Ian listens to a motivational audiobook called Kill or Be Killed – Using the Lessons of the Battlefield in the Boardroom
 Apparently it was written by someone in the Israeli Special Forces
 and it had been recommended to him by one of the personal trainers at the Virgin Active in Tunbridge Wells
 Ian isn’t certain if the personal trainer himself is Israeli
 but he looks like he’s from there or thereabouts
As the midday sun fails to force its way through the illegally tinted windows of the Range Rover
 Ian starts to think about Tony Curran again
 They’ve been very good for each other over the years
 Ian and Tony
 Ian would buy up tattered and tired old houses
 big ones
 Tony would gut them
 divide them up
 put in the ramps and the handrails
 and on they’d go to the next one
 The care-home business boomed
 and Ian built his fortune
 He kept a few
 he sold a few
 he bought a few more
Ian takes a smoothie from the Range Rover’s ice box
 The ice box had not come as standard
 A mechanic in Faversham had fitted it for him
 while he was gold-plating the glove box
 It is Ian’s regular smoothie
 A punnet of raspberries
 a fistful of spinach
 Icelandic yoghurt (Finnish
 if they are out of Icelandic)
 spirulina
 wheatgrass
 acerola cherry powder
 chlorella
 kelp
 acai extract
 cocoa nibs
 zinc
 beetroot essence
 chia seeds
 mango zest and ginger
 It is his own invention
 and he calls it Keep It Simple
He checks his watch
 About ten minutes until he gets to Coopers Chase
 Get the meeting done
 then break the news to Tony
 This morning he had googled ‘stab-proof vests’
 but the same-day delivery option had been unavailable
 Amazon Prime
 They must think he’s a mug
He’s sure it will be fine
 though
 And great news that Bogdan’s on board to take over
 A seamless transition
 And cheaper
 of course
 which is the whole point
Ian had worked out very early on that he needed to take his business upmarket if he wanted to make real money
 The worst thing was when clients died
 There was admin
 rooms left earning nothing as new clients were found and
 worst of all
 you’d have to deal with the families
 Now
 the richer a client was
 by and large the longer they would live
 Also
 the richer they were
 the less often their family would visit
 as they tended to live in London
 or New York
 or Santiago
 So Ian moved upmarket
 transforming his company
 Autumn Sunset Care Homes
 into Home from Home Independent Living
 concentrating on fewer
 bigger
 properties
 Tony Curran hadn’t blinked an eye
 What Tony didn’t know he would quickly learn
 and no wet room
 electronic key card or communal barbecue pit could faze him
 It seemed a shame to let him go really
 but there it was
Ian passes the wooden bus stop on his right
 and turns into the entrance to Coopers Chase
 As so often
 he follows a delivery van over the cattle grid
 and is stuck behind it all the way up the long driveway
 Taking in the view on the way
 he shakes his head
 So many llamas
 You live and learn
Ian parks up and makes sure his parking permit is correctly and prominently displayed
 on the left-hand side of his windscreen
 with permit number and expiration date clearly showing
 Ian has been in all sorts of scrapes with all sorts of authorities over the years
 and the only two that have ever truly rattled him are the Russian Import Tax Investigation Authority and the Coopers Chase Parking Committee
 Worth it
 though
 Whatever money he had made before
 Coopers Chase had been in another league entirely
 Ian and Tony both knew it
 A waterfall of money
 Which
 of course
 was the source of today’s problem
Coopers Chase
 Twelve acres of beautiful countryside
 with permission to build up to 400 retirement flats
 Nothing there but an empty convent
 and someone’s sheep up on the hill
 An old friend of his had bought the land off a priest a few years before
 then suddenly needed some quick cash to fight off extradition proceedings due to a misunderstanding
 Ian did the sums and realized this was a leap worth taking
 But Tony had done the sums too
 and decided to make a leap of his own
 Which is why Tony Curran now owned twenty-five per cent of everything that he built at Coopers Chase
 Ian had felt compelled to agree to the terms because Tony had never been anything but loyal to him
 and also because Tony had made it clear he would break both of Ian’s arms if he refused
 Ian had seen Tony break people’s arms before
 and so they were now partners
Not for long
 though
 Surely Tony knew it couldn’t last
 Anyone can build a luxury apartment really – strip to the waist
 listen to Magic FM
 dig out some foundations or shout at a bricklayer
 Easy work
 But not everyone has the vision to oversee someone building luxury apartments
 With the new development about to start
 what better time for Tony to learn his true value
Ian Ventham feels emboldened
 Kill or be killed
Ian gets out of the car
 and as he blinks into the sudden glare of the sun
 he just catches the aftertaste of beetroot essence that was one of the key obstacles to him launching Keep It Simple as a commercial proposition
 He could leave the beetroot essence out
 but it was essential to pancreatic health
Sunglasses on
 And so to business
 Ian is not planning on dying today
6
Ron Ritchie is
 as so often
 having none of it
 He is jabbing a practised finger at a copy of his lease
 He knows it looks good
 it always does
 but Ron can feel his finger shaking
 and the lease shaking
 He waves the lease in the air to hide the shakes
 His voice has lost none of its power
 though
‘Now here’s a quote
 And it’s your words
 Mr Ventham
 not my words
 “Coopers Chase Holding Investments reserves the right to develop further residential possibilities on the site
 in consultation with current residents”
’
Ron’s big frame hints at the physical power he must once have had
 The chassis is all still there
 like a bull-nosed truck rusting in a field
 His face
 wide and open
 is ready at a second’s notice to be outraged or incredulous
 or whatever else might be required
 Whatever might help
‘That’s what this is
’ says Ian Ventham
 as if talking to a child
 ‘This is the consultation meeting
 You’re the residents
 Consult all you like
 for the next twenty minutes
’
Ventham sits at a trestle table at the front of the Residents’ Lounge
 He is teak-tanned
 relaxed and has his sunglasses pushed up over his 1980s catalogue-model hair
 He is wearing an expensive polo shirt
 and a watch so large it might as well be a clock
 He looks like he smells great
 but you wouldn’t really want to get close enough to find out for certain
Ventham is flanked by a woman around fifteen years his junior and a tattooed man in a sleeveless vest
 scrolling through his phone
 The woman is the development architect
 the tattooed man is Tony Curran
 Ron has seen Curran around
 has heard about him too
 Ibrahim is writing down every word that’s said as Ron continues to jab in Ventham’s direction
‘I’m not falling for that old bull
 Ventham
 This ain’t a consultation
 it’s an ambush
’
Joyce decides to chip in
 ‘You tell him
 Ron
’
Ron fully intends to
‘Thanks
 Joyce
 You’re calling it “The Woodlands”
 even though you’re cutting down all the trees
 That’s rich
 old son
 You’ve got your nice little computer pictures
 all done up
 sun shining
 fluffy clouds
 little ducks swimming on ponds
 You can prove anything with computers
 son
 we wanted to see a proper scale model
 With model trees and little people
’
This gets a ripple of applause
 A lot of people had wanted to see a scale model
 but according to Ian Ventham it wasn’t the done thing these days
 Ron continues
‘And you’ve chosen
 deliberately chosen
 a woman architect
 so I won’t be allowed to shout
’
‘You are shouting though
 Ron
’ says Elizabeth
 who is two seats away
 reading a newspaper
‘Don’t you tell me when I’m shouting
 Elizabeth
’ shouts Ron
 ‘This geezer’ll know when I’m shouting
 Look at him
 dressed up like Tony Blair
 Why don’t you bomb the Iraqis while you’re at it
 Ventham
’
Good line
 thinks Ron
 as Ibrahim dutifully writes it down for the record
Back in the days when he was in the papers
 they called him ‘Red Ron’
 though everyone was ‘Red’ something in those days
 Ron’s picture was rarely in the papers without the caption ‘talks between the two sides collapsed late last night’
 A veteran of picket lines and police cells
 of blacklegs
 blacklists and bust-ups
 of slow-downs and sit-ins
 of wildcats and walkouts
 Ron had been there
 warming his hands over a brazier
 with the old gang at British Leyland
 Ron had seen
 first-hand
 the demise of the dockers
 Ron had picketed Wapping as he witnessed the victory of Rupert Murdoch and the collapse of the printers
 Ron had led the Kent miners up the A1 and had been arrested at Orgreave as the final resistance of the coal industry was crushed
 In fact
 a man less indefatigable than Ron might have considered himself a jinx
 But that’s the fate of the underdog
 and Ron simply loved to be the underdog
 If he ever found himself in a situation where he wasn’t the underdog
 he would twist and turn and shake that situation until he had convinced everyone that he was
 But Ron had always practised what he had preached
 He had always quietly helped anyone who had needed a leg-up
 needed a few extra quid at Christmas
 needed a suit or a solicitor for court
 Anyone who
 for any reason
 had needed a champion
 had always been safe in Ron’s tattooed arms
The tattoos are fading now
 the hands are shaking
 but the fire still burns
‘You know where you can shove this lease
 don’t you
 Ventham
’
‘Feel free to enlighten me
’ says Ian Ventham
Ron then starts to make a point about David Cameron and the EU referendum
 but loses his thread
 Ibrahim places a hand on his elbow
 Ron nods the nod of a man whose work here is done and he sits
 knees cracking like gunshots
He’s happy
 And he notices his shakes have stopped
 just for the moment
 Back in the fight
 There was nothing like it
7
As Father Matthew Mackie slips in at the back of the lounge
 a large man in a West Ham shirt is shouting about Tony Blair
 There is a big turnout
 as he had hoped
 That’s useful
 plenty of objections to the Woodlands development
 There had been no buffet service on the train from Bexhill
 and so he is glad to see there are biscuits
He grabs a handful when no one is looking
 takes a blue plastic seat in the back row and settles himself in
 The man in the tightly fitting football top is running out of steam now and
 as he sits down
 other hands go up
 Hopefully this was a wasted trip
 but it is far better to be safe than sorry
 Father Mackie is aware that he is nervous
 He adjusts his dog collar
 runs a hand through his shock of snowy-white hair and dips into his pocket for a shortbread finger
 If someone doesn’t ask about the cemetery
 perhaps he should
 Just be brave
 Remember he has a job to do
How peculiar to be in this room! He shivers
 Probably just the cold
8
The consultation over
 Ron is sitting with Joyce beside the bowling green
 cold beers glinting in the sunshine
 He is currently being distracted by a retired
 one-armed jeweller from Ruskin Court
 called Dennis Edmonds
Dennis
 to whom Ron has never spoken before
 wants to congratulate Ron on the very salient points he made during the consultation meeting
 ‘Thought-provoking
 Ron
 thought-provoking
 Plenty to chew on there
’
Ron thanks Dennis for his kind words
 and waits for the move that he knows is coming
 The move that always comes
‘And this must be your son
’ says Dennis
 turning towards Jason Ritchie
 also cradling a beer
 ‘The champ!’
Jason smiles and nods
 as polite as always
 Dennis extends his arm
 ‘Dennis
 I’m a friend of your dad’s
’
Jason shakes the man’s hand
 ‘Jason
 How do you do
 Dennis
’
Dennis stares for a beat
 waiting for Jason to start a conversation
 then nods enthusiastically
 ‘Well
 a pleasure to meet you
 I’m a huge fan
 seen all your fights
 We’ll see you soon again
 I hope
’
Jason nods politely again and Dennis ambles off
 forgetting even to pretend to say goodbye to Ron
 Father and son
 well used to these interruptions
 resume their conversation with Joyce
‘Yeah
 it’s called Famous Family Trees
’ says Jason
 ‘They’ve researched the family history and they want to take me round various places
 tell me a bit about
 you know
 family history
 Great-granny’s a prostitute and all that
’
‘I ain’t seen it
’ says Ron
 ‘What is it
 BBC
’
‘It’s ITV
 it’s really very good
 Ron
’ says Joyce
 ‘I saw one recently
 did you see it Jason
 with the actor
 He’s the doctor from Holby City
 but I’ve also seen him in a Poirot
’
‘I didn’t see it
 Joyce
’ says Jason
‘It was very interesting
 His grandfather
 it turns out
 had murdered his lover
 A gay lover as well
 His face was a picture
 Oh
 you should do it
 Jason
’ Joyce claps
 ‘Imagine if Ron had a gay granddad
 I’d enjoy that
’
Jason nods
 ‘They’d want to talk to you too
 Dad
 On camera
 They asked if you’d be up for it
 and I told them good luck shutting you up
’
Ron laughs
 ‘But are you really doing that Celebrity Ice Dance thing as well
’
‘I thought it might be fun
’
‘Oh
 I agree
’ says Joyce
 finishing her beer and reaching for another
‘You’re doing a lot at the moment
 Son
’ says Ron
 ‘Joyce says she saw you on MasterChef
’
Jason shrugs
 ‘You’re right
 Dad
 I should go back to boxing
’
‘I can’t believe you’d never made a macaroon before
 Jason
’ says Joyce
Ron knocks back some of his beer
 then motions over to his left with the bottle
‘Over by the BMW
 Jase – don’t look now – that’s Ventham
 the one I was telling you about
 I ran rings around him
 didn’t I
 Joyce
’
‘He didn’t know if he was coming or going
 Ron
’ agrees Joyce
Jason leans back and stretches
 a casual look to his left as he does so
 Joyce moves her chair to get a better view
‘Yeah
 nice and subtle
 Joyce
’ says Ron
 ‘That’s Curran with him
 Jase
 the builder
 You ever come across him in town
’
‘Once or twice
’ says Jason
Ron looks over again
 The conversation between the men looks tense
 Talking fast and low
 hands aggressive and defensive
 but contained
‘They having a little barney
 you think
’ he asks
Jason sips his beer and scans across to the car park again
 taking the men in
‘They’re like a couple out on a date
 pretending they’re not having an argument
’ says Joyce
 ‘In a Pizza Express
’
‘You’ve nailed it there
 Joyce
’ agrees Jason
 turning back to his dad and finishing his beer
‘Game of snooker this afternoon
 Son
’ says Ron
 ‘Or are you shooting off
’
‘Love to
 Dad
 but I’ve got a little errand
’
‘Anything I can help with
’
Jason shakes his head
 ‘Boring one
 won’t take long
’ He stands and stretches
 ‘You haven’t had any journalists ringing you up today
 have you
’
‘Should I have
’ asks Ron
 ‘Something up
’
‘Nah
 you know journalists
 But no calls
 no mail or anything
’
‘I had a catalogue for walk-in baths
’ says Ron
 ‘You want to tell me why you’re asking
’
‘You know me
 Dad
 they’re always after something
’
‘How exciting!’ says Joyce
‘See you both
’ says Jason
 ‘Don’t get drunk and smash the place up
’
Jason leaves
 Joyce turns her face up to the sun and closes her eyes
 ‘Well
 isn’t this lovely
 Ron
 I never knew I liked beer
 Imagine if I’d died at seventy
 I never would have known
’
‘Cheers to that
 Joyce
’ says Ron
 and polishes off his drink
 ‘What do you reckon’s up with Jason
’
‘Probably a woman
’ says Joyce
 ‘You know what we’re like
’
Ron nods
 ‘Probably
 yeah
’
He watches his son depart into the distance
 He’s worried
 But then there’s never been a day with Jason
 whether in the ring
 or out
 when Ron hasn’t worried
9
The consultation went well
 Ian Ventham is no longer worried about The Woodlands
 it’s a done deal
 The loud guy from the meeting
 He’d met his type before
 Let him blow himself out
 He’d also seen a priest at the back of the room
 What was that
 The cemetery
 he guessed
 but it was all above board
 he had all the permits
 Let them try and stop him
And sacking Tony Curran
 Well
 he hadn’t been happy
 but he hadn’t killed him either
 Advantage Ian
So
 Ian Ventham is already thinking ahead
 After The Woodlands is up and running there will be another
 final phase of the development
 Hillcrest
 He has driven the five minutes up a rough track from Coopers Chase and is now sitting in the country kitchen of Karen Playfair
 Her father
 Gordon
 owns the farmland at the top of the hill
 adjoining Coopers Chase
 and he seems in no mood to sell
 No matter
 Ian has his ways
‘I’m afraid nothing has changed
 Ian
’ says Karen Playfair
 ‘My dad won’t sell
 and I can’t make him
’
‘I hear you
’ says Ian
 ‘More money
’
‘No
 I think –’ says Karen
 ‘and I think you know this already – I think he just doesn’t like you
’
Gordon Playfair had taken one look at Ian Ventham and disappeared upstairs
 Ian could hear him stomping about
 proving whatever point he was proving
 Who cared
 Sometimes people didn’t like Ian
 He has never quite worked out why
 but over the years has learned to live with it
 Certainly
 it was their problem
 Gordon Playfair was just another in a long line of people who didn’t get him
‘But listen
 leave it with me
’ says Karen
 ‘I’ll find a way
 It’ll work for everyone
’
Karen Playfair gets him
 He has been talking her through the sort of money she could expect if she persuades her dad to sell up
 Her sister and brother-in-law have their own business
 organic raisins in Brighton
 and Ian has already tried this line on them
 and failed
 Karen Playfair is a much better bet
 She lives alone in a cottage on the land and she works in IT
 which you can tell just by looking at her
 She is wearing make-up
 but in a subtle
 understated way that Ian honestly can’t see the point of
Ian wonders exactly when Karen had given up on life and started wearing trainers and long
 baggy jumpers
 And you’d think
 given that she works in IT
 she could have googled ‘Botox’
 She must be fifty
 Ian thinks
 same age as him
 Different for women
 though
Ian is on a lot of dating apps
 and sets a strict upper age limit of twenty-five
 He finds the dating apps useful
 because it can be hard to meet exactly the right kind of women these days
 They need to understand that his time is limited and his work demanding
 and that commitment is hard for him
 Women over twenty-five don’t seem to get that
 in his experience
 What happens to them
 he wonders
 He tries to imagine why someone would choose to date Karen Playfair
 but draws a blank
 Conversation
 That runs out soon enough
 doesn’t it
 She’ll be rich soon
 of course
 when Ian buys the land
 That will help her
Hillcrest will be a real life-changer for Ian
 too
 It will eventually double the size of Coopers Chase
 and so double Ian’s profits
 Profits he will no longer have to share with Tony Curran
 If that meant having to flirt with a fifty-year-old for a couple of weeks then so be it
On dates
 Ian has his tried-and-tested material
 He’ll impress young women with pictures of his pool
 and the time he was interviewed on Kent Tonight
 He had already shown Karen a picture of his pool
 because you never knew
 but she had simply smiled politely and nodded
 No wonder she was single
He could do business with her
 though
 She knew the upsides here
 and she knew the obstacles
 and they end their conversation with a handshake and a plan of action
 As he shakes Karen’s hand
 Ian thinks that using a bit of hand cream every now and again wouldn’t kill her
 Fifty! He wouldn’t wish it on anyone
The thought briefly occurs to Ian that the only woman over twenty-five he spends any time with at all is his wife
Oh well
 time to go
 Things to do
10
Tony Curran has made up his mind
 He brings his BMW X7 to a halt on his heated driveway
 There is a gun buried under the sycamore in the back garden
 Or is it under the beech
 It’s one or the other
 but that’s something he can think about with a nice cup of tea
 And he can try to remember where his spade is
 while he’s at it
Tony Curran is going to kill Ian Ventham
 that’s a given now
 Surely Ian knows it too
 You can only take so many liberties before even the most calm and rational man snaps
Tony whistles a tune from an advert and heads indoors
He moved in about eighteen months ago
 on the first real profits from Coopers Chase
 It was the type of house he had always dreamed of
 A house built on hard work
 on making the right choices
 cutting the right corners and backing his own talent
 A monument to what he had achieved
 in brick
 glass and tempered walnut
Tony lets himself in and sets to work switching off the alarm
 Ventham had got some of his gang to fit it last week
 Polish
 the lot of them
 but then who isn’t these days
 Tony gets the four-digit code right on the third attempt
 A new record
Tony Curran has always taken his security very seriously
 For many years Tony’s building company had really just been a front for his drugs business
 A way to explain away his income
 A way to wash his dirty money
 But it slowly got bigger
 took up more of his time
 brought in more and more money
 If you’d told young Tony he would end up living in this house
 he wouldn’t have been at all surprised
 If you’d told him he’d be buying it with money earned legally
 he’d have keeled over there and then
His wife
 Debbie
 is not back
 but that suits him fine for now
 Gives him time to concentrate
 really think it all through
Tony rewinds to the row with Ian Ventham
 and his fury rises again
Ian was cutting him out of The Woodlands
 Just like that
 A conversation on the way to his car
 Outdoors
 just in case Tony felt like swinging a punch
 He would love to have smacked him there and then
 but that was the old Tony
 So they’d had a little row
 nice and quiet
 No one could possibly have noticed
 and that’s good for Tony
 When Ventham turns up dead
 no one can say they saw Tony Curran and Ian Ventham having a ding-dong
 Keeps it clean
Tony sits on a bar stool
 pulls it up to the island in his vast kitchen and slides open a drawer
 He needs to get a plan down on paper
Tony is not a believer in luck
 he’s a believer in hard work
 If you fail to prepare
 you prepare to fail
 An old English teacher of Tony’s had once told him that
 and he’d never forgotten it
 The next year he had torched the same teacher’s car
 following an argument about a football
 but Tony still had to hand it to the guy
 If you fail to prepare
 you prepare to fail
As it turns out
 there is no paper in the drawer
 so Tony decides to work out the plan in his head instead
Nothing needs to be done tonight
 Let the world continue for a while
 let the birds keep singing in the garden
 let Ventham think he has won
 And then strike
 Why did people ever mess with Tony Curran
 When had that ever worked out for anyone
Tony hears the noise a second too late
 He turns to see the spanner as it swings towards him
 A big one too
 real old-school stuff
 There’s no way of avoiding the swing and
 in the brief moment of realization he has
 Tony Curran gets it
 You can’t win ’em all
 Tony
 That’s fair enough
 he thinks
 that’s fair enough
The blow catches Tony on the left temple and he collapses to the marble floor
 The birds in the garden stop singing for the briefest of moments and then continue their merry tune
 High up in the sycamore tree
 Or is it the beech
The killer places a photograph on the worktop
 as Tony Curran’s fresh blood begins to form a moat around his walnut kitchen island
11
Coopers Chase always wakes early
 As the foxes finish their nightly rounds and the birds begin their roll-call
 the first kettles whistle and low lamps start to appear in curtained windows
 Morning joints creak into life
Nobody here is grabbing toast before an early train to the office
 or packing a lunchbox before waking the kids
 but there is much to do nonetheless
 Many years ago
 everybody here would wake early because there was a lot to do and only so many hours in the day
 Now they wake early because there is a lot to do and only so many days left
Ibrahim is always up by six
 The swimming pool doesn’t open until seven
 for health-and-safety reasons
 He has argued
 unsuccessfully
 that the risk of drowning while swimming unsupervised is dwarfed by the risk of dying from cardio-vascular disease or respiratory or circulatory illness due to lack of regular exercise
 He even produced an algorithm proving that keeping the pool open twenty-four hours a day
 would make residents thirty-one point seven per cent safer than closing it overnight
 The Leisure & Recreation Amenities Committee remained unmoved
 Ibrahim could see that their hands were tied by various directives and so held no grudge
 The algorithm was neatly filed away
 should it ever be needed again
 There was always a lot to do
‘I have a job for you
 Ibrahim
’ says Elizabeth
 sipping a mint tea
 ‘Well
 a job for you and Ron
 but I’m putting you in charge
’
‘Very wise
’ says Ibrahim
 nodding
 ‘If I might say
’
Elizabeth had rung him the night before with the news about Tony Curran
 She had heard from Ron
 who had heard it from Jason
 who had heard it from a source yet to be documented
 Dead in his kitchen
 blunt force trauma to the head
 found by his wife
Ibrahim usually likes to spend this hour looking through old case notes and sometimes even new ones
 He still has a few clients and
 if they are ever in need
 they will make the trip out to Coopers Chase and sit in the battered chair under the painting of the sailing boat
 both of which have followed him around for nearly forty years now
 Yesterday
 Ibrahim had been reading the notes of an old client of his
 a Midland Bank manager from Godalming who took in stray dogs and killed himself one Christmas Day
 No such luck this morning
 Ibrahim thinks
 Elizabeth had arrived with the sunrise
 He is finding the break in his routine challenging
‘All I need you to do is to lie to a senior police officer
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Can I trust you with that
’
‘When can you not trust me
 Elizabeth
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘When have I let you down
’
‘Well
 never
 Ibrahim
’ agrees Elizabeth
 ‘That’s why I like to keep you around
 Also
 you make very good tea
’
Ibrahim knows he is a safe pair of hands
 Over the years he has saved lives and saved souls
 He was good at what he did
 and that’s why
 even now
 some people will drive for miles
 past the old phone box and the farm shop
 turning right just after the bridge and left by the wooden bus stop
 just to speak to an eighty-year-old psychiatrist
 long retired
Sometimes he fails – who doesn’t
 in this world
 – and those are the files that Ibrahim will reach for in those early mornings
 The bank manager who sat in the battered chair and cried and cried and could not be saved
But this morning there are different priorities
 he understands that
 This morning the Thursday Murder Club has a real-life case
 Not just yellowing pages of smudged type from another age
 A real case
 a real corpse and
 somewhere out there
 a real killer
This morning Ibrahim is needed
 Which is what he lives for
12
PC Donna De Freitas carries a tray of teas into the incident room
 A local builder
 Tony something
 has been murdered
 and judging by the size of the assembled team it’s a big deal
 Donna wonders why
 If she takes her time with the teas
 maybe she can find out
DCI Chris Hudson is addressing the team
 He always seems nice enough
 He once opened some double doors for her without looking like he wanted a medal for it
‘There are cameras at the property
 and plenty of them
 Get the footage
 Tony Curran left Coopers Chase at 2 p
m
 and he died at 3
32
 according to his Fitbit
 That’s only a small window to search
’
Donna has placed the tea tray on a desk while she stoops to tie her shoelace
 She hears Coopers Chase mentioned
 which is interesting
‘There are also cameras on the A214
 around 400 metres south of Curran’s home
 and half a mile north
 so let’s get hold of that footage too
 You know the time frame
’ Chris stops for a moment and looks over at where Donna De Freitas is crouching
‘Everything all right
 Constable
’ he asks
Donna straightens up
 ‘Yes
 sir
 just tying my shoelaces
 Wouldn’t want to trip with a tray of tea
’
‘Very wise
’ agrees Chris
 ‘Thank you for the tea
 We’ll let you get on now
’
‘Thank you
 sir
’ says Donna
 and walks towards the door
She realizes that Chris – a detective of course – has probably spotted that her shoes have no laces
 But surely he wouldn’t blame a young constable for a bit of healthy curiosity
As she opens the door to leave she hears Chris Hudson continue
‘Until we get all that
 the biggest lead is the photograph the killer left by the body
 Let’s take a look
’
Donna can’t resist turning and sees
 projected onto the wall
 an old photograph
 three men in a pub
 laughing and drinking
 Their table is covered in banknotes
 She only has a moment
 but she recognizes one of the men immediately
Things would be very different when Donna was part of a murder squad
 very different
 No more visiting primary schools to write serial numbers on bikes in invisible ink
 No more politely reminding local shopkeepers that overflowing bins were actually a criminal off–
‘Constable
’ says Chris
 snapping Donna from her train of thought
 Donna takes her eyes off the photo and looks at Chris
 Firmly
 but kindly
 he motions that she is free to leave
 Donna smiles at Chris and nods
 ‘Daydreaming
 Sorry
 sir
’
She opens the door
 walks through
 back to the boredom
 She strains to hear every last word before the door finally swings shut
‘So
 three men
 all of whom we obviously know very well
 Shall we take them one by one
’
The door clunks shut
 Donna sighs
13
Joyce
I hope you will forgive a morning diary entry
 but Tony Curran is dead
Tony Curran is the builder who put this place up
 Perhaps he even laid the bricks in my fireplace
 Who knows
 I mean
 probably not
 He probably had someone else to do that for him
 didn’t he
 And all the plastering and what have you
 He would have just overseen things
 I suppose
 But I bet his fingerprints are here somewhere
 Which is quite a thrill
Elizabeth rang me last night with the news
 I would never describe Elizabeth as breathless
 but
 honestly
 she wasn’t far off
Tony Curran was bludgeoned
 of all things
 by hand
 or hands
 unknown
 I told her what I’d seen with Ron and Jason
 the row between Curran and Ian Ventham
 She told me she already knew
 so she must have spoken to Ron before she spoke to me
 but she was polite enough to listen as I gave my view of it
 I asked her if she was taking notes and she said she would remember it
Anyway
 Elizabeth seems to have some sort of plan
 She said she is seeing Ibrahim this morning
I asked her if there was any way I might be able to help and she said that there was
 So I asked her what that way might be and she said if I held my horses
 I would find out soon enough
So I suppose I sit and wait for instructions
 I’m going to take the minibus into Fairhaven later
 but I shall keep my mobile on just in case
I have become someone who has to keep their mobile on
14
‘So who killed Tony Curran
 and how do we catch him
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘Or catch “him or her”
 I know I should say
 but it’s probably “him”
 What kind of woman would bludgeon someone
 A Russian woman
 but that’s about it
’
After giving Ibrahim his instructions for the day
 Elizabeth had headed straight over for this chat
 She is in her usual chair
‘He absolutely seems the type to have had enemies
 Sleeveless vest
 big house
 more tattoos than Ron
 so on and so forth
 The police will be making a list of suspects right now and we’ll have to get our hands on it
 In the absence of their list
 though
 why don’t we look at whether Ian Ventham killed Tony Curran
 You remember Ian Ventham
 With the after-shave
 Ventham and Tony Curran had a little fight
 Ron saw them
 of course – when does he ever miss a thing
 And Joyce said something about Pizza Express
 but I knew what she meant
’
Elizabeth tries to mention Joyce more often these days
 because why deny it
‘Shall we make some reasonable assumptions
 Let’s say that Ventham is unhappy with Curran
 or Curran is unhappy with Ventham
 It doesn’t much matter which
 They have something to discuss
 and yet they meet in public
 which is peculiar
’
Elizabeth checks her watch
 She is subtle about it
 despite everything
‘So
 let’s say straight after the consultation meeting
 Ventham has bad news to break
 He fears Curran’s reaction so much that he meets him in public view
 He hopes to placate him
 But in Ron’s view he was “unsuccessful”
 I’m paraphrasing Ron there
’
There is a small sponge cube on a stick next to the bed
 Elizabeth places it in a jug of water and wets Penny’s dry lips
 The metallic chirp of Penny’s heart monitor fills the silence
‘So how would Ventham react
 in that scenario
 Penny
 Facing Curran with a grudge
 Switch to plan B
 Follow Curran to his house
 “Let me in
 let’s just talk about this
 perhaps I’ve been too hasty
” And then
 wallop!
 as simple as that
 don’t you think
 He kills Curran before Curran kills him
’
Elizabeth looks around for her bag
 She places her hands on the arms of the chair
 ready to leave
‘But why
 That’s the question I know you’d ask
 I’m going to try and take a look at their financial relationship
 Chase the money
 There’s a man in Geneva who owes me a favour
 so we should be able to get Ventham’s financial records by this evening
 Either way
 it sounds like fun
 doesn’t it
 An adventure
 And I think we’ll have a few tricks that the police won’t
 I’m sure they’d appreciate a bit of help
 and that’s my task for this morning
’
Elizabeth gets out of her chair and walks to the side of the bed
‘A real murder to investigate
 Penny
 I promise I won’t let you miss a thing
’
She kisses her best friend on the forehead
 She turns to the chair on the other side of the bed and gives a small smile
‘How are you
 John
’
Penny’s husband puts down his book and looks up
‘Oh
 you know
’
‘I do know
 You always know where I am
 John
’
The nurses say Penny Gray can hear nothing
 but who is to say
 John never speaks to Penny while Elizabeth is in the room
 He comes into Willows at seven each morning and he leaves at nine each evening
 back to the flat that he and Penny had lived in together
 Back to the holiday trinkets and the old photos and the memories that he and Penny shared for fifty years
 She knows that he talks to Penny when she is not there
 And every time she walks in
 always after knocking
 she notices the fading white prints of John’s hand on Penny’s
 His hand back on his book
 though he always seems to be on the same page
Elizabeth leaves the lovers together
15
Joyce
Every Wednesday I take the residents’ minibus into Fairhaven to do a spot of shopping
 On Mondays it goes to Tunbridge Wells
 half an hour in the other direction
 but I like the younger feel of Fairhaven
 I like to see what people are wearing and I like to hear the seagulls
 The driver’s name is Carlito and he is generally understood to be Spanish
 but I have chatted to him a number of times now and it turns out he is Portuguese
 He is very good about it though
There is a vegan café
 just off the seafront
 that I found a few months ago and I am already looking forward to a nice mint tea and an almond-flour brownie
 I am not a vegan and have no intention of ever becoming one
 but I still feel like it’s something that should be encouraged
 I read that if mankind doesn’t stop eating meat
 there will be mass starvation by 2050
 With respect
 I am nearly eighty and so this won’t be my problem
 but I do hope they sort it out
 My daughter Joanna is vegetarian and one day I will take her there
 We’ll just drop in
 as if me visiting a vegan café is the most natural thing in the world
The usual crowd are always on the bus
 There are the regulars
 Peter and Carol
 a nice couple from Ruskin
 who take the minibus down to visit their daughter who lives on the front
 I know there are no grandkids
 but nonetheless she seems to be at home during the day
 There will be a story there
 There’s Sir Nicholas
 who just goes for a mooch now they won’t let him drive any more
 There’s Naomi with her hip that they can’t get to the bottom of and a woman from Wordsworth whose name I have never quite caught and am now too embarrassed to ask
 She is friendly enough though
 (Elaine
)
I know that Bernard will be in his customary position at the back
 I always feel like I would like to sit next to him
 he is jolly company when he turns his mind to it
 But I know he visits Fairhaven for his late wife
 so I leave him in peace
 That’s where they met and that’s where they lived before they moved in here
 He told me that since she died he would go to the Adelphi Hotel where she used to work and polish off a couple of glasses of wine
 overlooking the sea
 That’s how I first found out about the minibus
 if I’m honest
 so silver linings
 They turned the Adelphi into a Travelodge last year
 so now Bernard sits on the pier
 That is less desolate than it sounds
 as they recently revamped it and it has won a number of awards
Perhaps I will just sit next to him at the back of the bus one day
 what am I waiting for
I’m looking forward to my tea and brownie
 but I’m also looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet
 The whole of Coopers Chase is still gossiping about poor Tony Curran
 We are around death a lot here
 but even so
 Not everyone is bludgeoned
 are they
Right
 that’s me
 If anything happens
 I will report back
16
As the minibus is about to leave
 the doors slide open for a final time and Elizabeth steps in
 She takes the seat next to Joyce
‘Good morning
 Joyce
’ she says
 smiling
‘Well
 this is a first
’ says Joyce
 ‘How lovely!’
‘I’ve brought a book
 if you don’t want to talk on the journey
’ says Elizabeth
‘Ooh no
 let’s talk
’ says Joyce
Carlito pulls away with his customary care
‘Splendid!’ says Elizabeth
 ‘I haven’t really brought a book
’
Elizabeth and Joyce settle into conversation
 They are very careful not to talk about the Tony Curran case
 One of the first things you learn at Coopers Chase is that some people can still actually hear
 Instead
 Elizabeth tells Joyce about the last time she went to Fairhaven
 which was sometime in the 1960s and whose purpose concerned a piece of equipment that had washed up on the beach
 Elizabeth refuses to be drawn into details
 but tells Joyce it was almost certainly now a matter of public record and she could presumably look it up somewhere if she was interested
 The journey passes very pleasantly
 The sun is up
 the skies are blue and murder is in the air
As always
 Carlito stops the minibus outside Ryman’s
 Everyone knows to meet back here in three hours’ time
 Carlito has done this job for two years now and not a single person has ever been late
 Except for Malcolm Weekes
 who
 as it turned out
 had died in the lightbulb aisle in Robert Dyas
Joyce and Elizabeth let the others out first
 allowing their assault course of ramps and sticks and frames to disperse
 Bernard doffs his hat to the ladies as he exits and they watch as he shuffles towards the seafront
 his Daily Express tucked under his arm
As they step down from the bus and Elizabeth thanks Carlito for his considerate driving in perfect Portuguese
 Joyce thinks to ask for the first time what Elizabeth is planning to do in Fairhaven
‘Same as you
 dear
 Shall we
’ Elizabeth starts walking away from the seafront and Joyce chooses to follow
 keen for adventure
 but still hopeful she might have time for her tea and brownie
A short walk away is Western Road and the broad stone steps of Fairhaven Police Station
 Elizabeth turns back to Joyce
 as the automatic doors open in front of her
‘Here’s the way I see it
 Joyce
 If we are going to investigate this murder …’
‘We’re going to investigate the murder
’ asks Joyce
‘Of course we are
 Joyce
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Who better than us
 But we have no access to any case files
 any witness statements
 any forensics
 and we are going to have to change that
 Which is why we’re here
 I know I don’t need to say this
 Joyce
 but just back me up
 whatever happens
’
Joyce nods
 of course
 of course
 They walk in
Once inside
 the two ladies are buzzed through a security door into a public reception area
 Joyce has never been inside a police station before
 though has watched every ITV documentary going and is disappointed that no one is being wrestled to the ground and dragged to a cell
 their obscenities thrillingly bleeped out
 Instead there is just a young desk sergeant
 pretending he isn’t playing patience on his Home Office computer
‘How can I help you
 ladies
’ he asks
Elizabeth starts to cry
 Joyce manages to control her double-take
‘Someone just stole my bag
 Outside Holland & Barrett
’ weeps Elizabeth
So that’s why she didn’t have a bag with her
 thinks Joyce
 That had been bugging her in the minibus
 Joyce puts her arm around her friend’s shoulders
 ‘It was awful
’
‘Let me get an officer to take a statement from you and we’ll see what we can do
’ The desk sergeant presses a buzzer on the wall to his left and within seconds a young constable enters through a further security door behind him
‘Mark
 this lady has just had her handbag stolen on Queens Road
 Can you take a statement
 I’ll make a cuppa for everyone
’
‘Certainly
 Madam
 if you’ll follow me
’
Elizabeth stands her ground and refuses to move
 She is shaking her head
 cheeks wet with tears now
‘I want to talk to a female police constable
’
‘I’m sure Mark can sort this out for you
’ says the desk sergeant
‘Please!’ cries Elizabeth
Joyce decides the time has come to help her friend out
‘My friend is a nun
 Sergeant
’
‘A nun
’ says the desk sergeant
‘Yes
 a nun
’ says Joyce
 ‘And I’m sure I don’t need to tell you what that entails
’
The desk sergeant sees that this is a discussion that could end badly in so many ways and chooses an easy life
‘If you’ll give me a moment
 madam
 I will find someone for you
’
He follows Mark back through the security door and Elizabeth and Joyce are alone for a minute
 Elizabeth stops the waterworks and looks over at Joyce
‘A nun
 That was very good
’
‘I didn’t have much time to think
’ says Joyce
‘If pushed
 I was going to say someone had touched me
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘You know how hot they are on that these days
 But a nun is much more fun
’
‘Why do you want to see a female officer
’ Joyce has a number of other questions now
 but this is first in the queue
 ‘And well done on not saying WPC
 by the way
 I’m proud of you
’
‘Thank you
 Joyce
 I just thought that
 as the bus was going into Fairhaven anyway
 we should pop in and see PC De Freitas
’
Joyce nods slowly
 In Elizabeth’s world that is absolutely the sort of thing that makes sense
 ‘But what if she’s not on shift
 Or what if she is
 but there are other female constables
’
‘Would I have brought you here if I hadn’t already checked that
 Joyce
’
‘How did you check th—’
The security door opens and Donna De Freitas steps through
 ‘Now
 ladies
 how can I –’ Donna registers who is in front of her
 She looks from Elizabeth to Joyce and back again
 ‘– help you

DCI Chris Hudson has been given a file on Tony Curran so thick it makes a pleasing thud if you drop it on a desk
 Which is what he has just done
Chris takes a swig of Diet Coke
 He sometimes worries he is addicted to it
 He had read a headline about Diet Coke once
 which was so worrying he had chosen not to read the article
He opens the file
 Most of Tony Curran’s dealings with Kent Police were from before Chris’s time in Fairhaven
 Charges for assault in his twenties
 minor drug convictions
 dangerous driving
 dangerous dog
 possession of an illegal weapon
 A tax disc misdemeanour
 Public urination
Then comes the real story
 Chris opens an indeterminate sandwich from the garage
 There are transcripts of a number of interviews held with Tony Curran over the years
 with the last one being after a shooting in the Black Bridge pub
 which left a young drug dealer dead
 A witness recognized Tony Curran as firing the fatal shot and Fairhaven CID called Curran in for questioning
Tony Curran had been in the middle of everything back then
 Ask around and anyone would tell you
 Tony ran the drugs trade in Fairhaven
 and plenty more besides
 Made a lot of money
Chris reads the depressingly familiar stream of ‘no comments’ on the Black Bridge transcript
 He reads that the witness
 a local taxi driver
 had disappeared soon after
 Scared away
 or worse
 Tony Curran
 local builder
 walked away scot-free
So what was that
 One death
 Two
 The drug dealer shot at the Black Bridge and
 perhaps
 the poor taxi driver who witnessed it
Since 2000 though
 nothing
 A speeding ticket
 promptly paid
 in 2009
He looks at the photograph the killer had left by the body
 Three men
 Tony Curran
 now dead
 With his arm around Tony was a local dealer from back in the day
 Bobby Tanner
 Hired as muscle
 Whereabouts currently unknown
 but they would track him down soon enough
 And the third man
 whereabouts very much known
 The ex-boxer Jason Ritchie
 Chris wonders what the newspapers would pay for this photo
 He has heard of officers doing this
 The lowest of the low
 as far as Chris is concerned
 He looks at the smiles
 the banknotes and the beers
 It was probably sometime around 2000
 when the boy was shot in the Black Bridge
 Funny to think of the year 2000 as ancient history
Chris opens a Twix as he studies the photo
 He has his annual medical in two months and every Monday he convinces himself that this is finally the week he gets back into shape
 finally shifts the stone or so that holds him back
 The stone or so that gives him cramp
 The stone or so that stops him buying new clothes
 just in case
 and that stops him dating
 because who would want this
 The stone or so that stands between him and the world
 Two stone if he’s really honest
Those Mondays are usually good
 Chris doesn’t take the lift on Mondays
 Chris brings food from home on Mondays
 Chris does sit-ups in bed on Mondays
 But by Tuesday
 or
 in a good week
 Wednesday
 the world creeps back in
 the stairs seem too daunting and Chris loses faith in the project
 He’s aware that the project is himself
 and that drags him further down still
 So out come the pasties and the crisps
 the petrol-station lunch
 the quick drink after work
 the takeaway on the way home from work
 the chocolate on the way home from the takeaway
 The eating
 the numbing
 the release
 the shame and then repeat
But there was always next Monday and one of these Mondays there would be salvation
 That stone would drop off
 followed by the other stone that was lurking
 He’d barely break sweat at the medical
 he’d be the athlete he always secretly knew he was
 Text a thumbs-up to the new girlfriend he’d have met online
He finishes the Twix and looks around for his crisps
Chris Hudson guesses that the Black Bridge shooting was the wake-up call that Tony Curran had needed
 That was certainly how it looked
 He had started working with a local property developer called Ian Ventham around this time
 and perhaps he decided life would be simpler if he turned legit
 There was good money in it
 even if it was not what he had grown used to
 Tony must have known he couldn’t keep riding his luck
Chris opens his crisps and looks at his watch
 He has an appointment and he should probably head off
 Someone saw Tony Curran having a row just before he died
 and that someone is insisting on talking to him personally
 It’s not a long trip
 The retirement community Curran had been working at
Chris looks at the photo again
 The three men
 that happy gang
 Tony Curran and Bobby Tanner
 arms around each other
 And
 off to the side
 a bottle in his hand and that handsome broken nose
 maybe a couple of years past the height of his powers
 Jason Ritchie
Three friends
 drinking beer
 at a table covered with money
 Why leave the photo by the body
 A warning from Bobby Tanner or Jason Ritchie
 A warning to them
 You’re next
 More likely a red herring
 or a misdirect
 No one would be so stupid
Either way
 Chris will need to have a chat with Jason Ritchie
 And
 hopefully
 his team will find their missing man
 Bobby Tanner
Actually
 their missing men
 thinks Chris
 tipping the last of his crisps into his mouth
Because
 who took the photograph in the first place

Donna motions for her two visitors to sit
 They are in Interview Suite B
 a boxy
 windowless room
 with a wooden table bolted to the floor
 Joyce looks around her with the excitement of a tourist
 Elizabeth looks at home
 Donna has her eyes on the heavy door
 waiting for it to swing shut
 The moment it clicks into place she looks straight at Elizabeth
‘So you’re a nun now
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth nods quickly
 raising a finger to acknowledge that this is a good question
 ‘Donna
 like any modern woman
 I am any number of things
 as and when the need arises
 We have to be chameleons
 don’t we
’ She takes a notepad and pen from an inside coat pocket and places them on the table
 ‘But Joyce takes the credit for that one
’
Joyce is still staring around the room
 ‘This is exactly like you see on television
 PC De Freitas
 How wonderful! It must be so much fun to work here
’
Donna is not sharing in the sense of awe
 ‘So
 Elizabeth
 Have you had a bag stolen
’
‘No
 dear
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Good luck to anyone trying to steal my bag
 Can you imagine
’
‘Then can I ask what the two of you are doing here
 I have work that needs finishing
’
Elizabeth nods
 ‘Of course
 that’s very reasonable
 Well
 I’m here because I wanted to talk to you about something
 And Joyce was here for shopping
 I presume
 Joyce
 I realize I haven’t asked
’
‘I like to go to Anything with a Pulse
 the vegan café
 if you know it
’
Donna looks at her watch
 then leans forward
 ‘Well
 here I am
 If you want to talk
 go ahead
 I’ll give you two minutes before I go back to catching criminals
’
Elizabeth gives a light clap of the hands
 ‘Excellent! Well
 first I will say this
 Stop pretending you are not pleased to see us again
 because I know that you are
 And we’re pleased to see you again
 This will be so much more fun if we can all just accept that
’
Donna does not reply
 Joyce leans in to the tape recorder sitting on the table
 ‘For the purposes of the tape
 PC De Freitas refuses to answer
 but is attempting to hide a slight smile
’
‘Secondly
 but connected to that
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘whatever it is we are keeping you from
 I know one thing for certain
 it isn’t catching criminals
 It is something boring
’
‘No comment
’ deadpans Donna
‘Where are you from
 Donna
 May I call you Donna
’
‘You may
 I’m from south London
’
‘Transferred from the Met
’
Donna nods
 Elizabeth makes a note in her book
‘You’re taking notes
’ asks Donna
Elizabeth nods
 ‘Why so
 And why to Fairhaven
’
‘That’s a story for another day
 You have one more question before I leave the room
 Fun though this is
’
‘Of course
’ replies Elizabeth
 She shuts her notebook and adjusts her glasses
 ‘Well
 I have a statement really
 but I promise it ends with a question
’
Donna turns up her palms
 inviting Elizabeth to continue
‘This is what I see
 and I know you’ll stop me if I misspeak
 You are in your mid twenties
 you give the impression of being clever and intuitive
 You also give the impression of being very kind
 yet very handy should a fight erupt
 For reasons we will get to the bottom of
 almost certainly a doomed relationship
 you have left London
 where I would have thought the life and the work would have suited you to a T
 You find yourself here
 in Fairhaven
 where the crime is minor and the criminals are petty
 And you are pounding the streets
 Maybe a junkie steals a bicycle
 Donna
 maybe someone drives off from a petrol station without paying
 or maybe there’s a fight
 over a girl
 in a pub
 Goodness me
 what a bore
 For reasons that are not of importance
 I once worked in a bar in the former Yugoslavia for three months and my brain was screaming out for excitement
 for stimulation
 for something extraordinary to happen
 Does that sound familiar
 You are single
 you are living in a rented flat
 you have not found it easy to make friends in the town
 Most of your colleagues in the station are a bit old for you
 I’m sure that young PC
 Mark
 has asked you out
 but there’s no way he could handle a south London girl
 so you had to say no
 You both still find it awkward
 That poor boy
 Your pride won’t allow you to go back to the Met for a good while and so you’re stuck here for the time being
 You’re still the new girl
 so promotion is a pretty distant prospect
 added to the fact you’re not all that popular because
 deep down
 everyone can tell you’ve made a mistake and you resent being here
 You can’t even quit
 Why throw away these years on the force
 the tough years
 just because of a wrong turn
 So you strap on the uniform and you turn up
 shift after shift
 teeth gritted
 just waiting for something extraordinary to happen
 Like
 perhaps
 a woman who isn’t a nun
 pretending her bag has been stolen
’
Elizabeth raises an eyebrow at Donna
 looking for a response
 Donna is utterly impassive
 utterly unimpressed
 ‘I’m still waiting for the question
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth nods
 and opens her notebook again
 ‘My question is this
 Wouldn’t you like to be investigating the Tony Curran murder
’
There is silence as Donna slowly weaves her hands together and rests her chin on them
 She considers Elizabeth very carefully before speaking
‘There is already a team investigating the Tony Curran murder
 Elizabeth
 A highly qualified murder squad
 I recently delivered tea to it
 They don’t really have a vacancy for a PC who tuts every time she gets asked to do the photocopying
 Have you ever thought it’s possible you don’t really understand how the police works
’
Elizabeth notes this down and talks as she writes
 ‘Mmm
 that is possible
 How complicated it all must be
 But a lot of fun
 I imagine
’
‘I imagine too
’ agrees Donna
‘They say he was bludgeoned
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘With a large spanner
 Could you confirm that
’
‘No comment
 Elizabeth
’ says Donna
Elizabeth stops writing and looks up again
 ‘Wouldn’t you like to be part of it
 Donna
’
Donna starts to drum her fingers on the desk
 ‘OK
 Let’s just suppose I would like to be involved in the murder investigation …’
‘Yes
 quite
 let’s suppose that
 Let’s start there and see where we get to
’
‘You do understand how CID works
 Elizabeth
 I can’t simply ask to be assigned to a particular investigation
’
Elizabeth smiles
 ‘Oh goodness
 don’t you worry about that
 Donna
 we can take care of it all
’
‘You can take care of it
’
‘I should have thought so
 yes
’
‘How
’ asks Donna
‘Well
 there’s always a way
 isn’t there
 But you would be interested
 If we could make it happen
’
Donna looks back to the heavy door
 safely shut
 ‘When could you make that happen
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth looks at her watch and gives a small shrug
 ‘An hour
 perhaps
’
‘And this conversation never leaves this room
’
Elizabeth puts a finger to her lips
‘Then I would
 Yes
 please
’ Donna holds up her hands
 open and honest
 ‘I would really
 really like to chase murderers
’
Elizabeth smiles and puts her notebook back in her pocket
 ‘Well
 this is smashing
 I thought I had read the situation correctly
’
‘What’s in it for you
’ asks Donna
‘Nothing
 other than a favour to a new friend
 And we might have the odd question here or there
 about the investigation
 Just to satisfy our curiosity
’
‘You know I couldn’t tell you anything confidential
 That’s not a deal I can agree to
’
‘Nothing unprofessional
 I promise you
’ Elizabeth crosses herself
 ‘As a woman of God
’
‘And in an hour you say
’
Elizabeth looks at her watch
 ‘I’d say about an hour
 Depending on the traffic
’
Donna nods
 as if this makes complete sense
 ‘About your little speech
 though
 Elizabeth
 I don’t know if it was designed to impress me
 or to show off in front of Joyce
 but it was pretty obvious stuff
’
Elizabeth concedes the point
 ‘Obvious
 but right
 dear
’
‘Almost right
 but you’re not quite
 Miss Marple
 Is she
 Joyce
’
Joyce pipes up
 ‘Oh yes
 that boy Mark is gay
 Elizabeth
 You’d have to be fairly blind to miss that
’
Donna smiles
 ‘Lucky you have your friend with you
 Sister
’ She likes that Elizabeth is attempting to hide a smile of her own
‘I’ll need your mobile number
 by the way
 Donna
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘I don’t really want to fake a crime every time I need to see you
’
Donna slides a card over the table
‘I hope that’s a personal number and not an official one
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘It would be nice to have some privacy
’
Donna looks at Elizabeth
 shakes her head and sighs
 She writes down another number on the card
‘Lovely
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘I suspect between us we can find whoever killed Tony Curran
 It can’t be beyond the wit of man
 Or rather woman
’
Donna stands
 ‘Should I ask how you can get me on the investigating team
 Elizabeth
 or don’t I want to know
’
Elizabeth checks her watch
 ‘Nothing you need to concern yourself with
 Ron and Ibrahim should be taking care of it about now
’
Joyce waits for Elizabeth to stand too
 then leans into the tape recorder once again
 ‘Interview terminated

DCI Chris Hudson swings his Ford Focus onto the long
 broad driveway leading up to Coopers Chase
 The traffic hasn’t been at all bad and he is hoping this won’t take too long
As he checks out his surroundings
 Chris wonders why this place needs quite so many llamas
 There are no spaces in the visitors’ car park
 so he eases the Focus onto a verge and steps out into the Kent sun
Chris has been to retirement communities before and this is not at all what he had been expecting
 This is a whole village
 He wanders past a bowls match
 wine chilling in coolers at each end
 One of the players is an extremely elderly woman smoking a pipe
 He follows a meandering path through a perfect English garden
 flanked by three storeys of flats
 There are people gossiping on patios and balconies
 enjoying the sunshine
 Friends sit on benches
 bees buzz round bushes
 light breezes play tunes with ice cubes
 Chris finds the whole thing deeply infuriating
 He’s a wind-and-rain guy
 a turn-up-the-collar-on-your-overcoat man
 If Chris had his way he would hibernate for the summer
 He has not worn shorts since 1987
Chris crosses a residents’ car park
 past a red postbox looking picture-book perfect
 annoying him further
 and finds Wordsworth Court
He rings the buzzer for flat 11
 Mr Ibrahim Arif
After being buzzed up and walking across a lushly carpeted hallway and up a lushly carpeted staircase and knocking on a solid oak door
 Chris finds himself in that flat of Ibrahim Arif
 sitting opposite the man himself and also opposite Ron Ritchie
Ron Ritchie
 Well
 wasn’t that quite the thing
 Chris had been taken aback the moment they had been introduced
 The father of a man Chris was investigating – what was that
 Luck
 Something more sinister
 Chris decides he will just let it play out
 He trusts that
 if there is an angle
 he will spot it
Strange that this is where ‘Red Ron’ ended up
 though
 The scourge of the bosses
 the Beast of British Leyland
 and British Steel
 and British whatever else you’d care to mention
 Amidst the honeysuckle and Audis of Coopers Chase
 Chris would have barely recognized him
 to be honest
 Ron Ritchie is wearing mismatched pyjamas
 an unzipped tracksuit top and dress shoes
 He is looking around vacantly
 mouth open
 He is a mess and Chris feels awkward
 as if he is imposing on a private scene
Ibrahim is explaining the situation to DCI Chris Hudson
‘It can be very stressful for elderly people to talk to police officers
 You mustn’t think that’s your fault
 This is why I suggested you conduct the interview here
’
Chris nods gently
 because he has done the training
 ‘I can assure you that Mr Ritchie is not in trouble
 but if
 as you say
 he has information
 I will need to ask him a couple of questions
’
Ibrahim turns to Ron
‘Ron
 he just wants to ask you about the argument you saw
 Remember
 we talked about it
’ Ibrahim looks back to Chris
 ‘He forgets things
 He’s very old
 Detective Chief Inspector
 A very
 very old man
’
‘All right
 Ibrahim
’ says Ron
Ibrahim pats Ron’s hand and speaks to him slowly
‘I think it’s quite safe
 Ron
 We’ve seen this gentleman’s warrant card
 I rang the number on it
 then I googled him
 Remember
’
‘I just … I just don’t think I can
’ says Ron
 ‘I don’t want to get into any trouble
’
‘There won’t be any trouble
 Mr Ritchie
’ says Chris
 ‘I guarantee it
 It’s just that you might have important information
’ ‘Red Ron’ is a shadow of his former self and Chris is very aware that he must play this carefully
 Certainly don’t mention Jason yet
 The possibility of a pub lunch is also rapidly vanishing
 ‘Mr Arif is right
 you can tell me anything
’
Ron looks at Chris
 then back to Ibrahim for signs of reassurance
 Ibrahim squeezes his friend’s arm and Ron looks at Chris again
 then leans forward
‘I think I’d be happier talking to the lady
’
Chris is taking his first sip of the mint tea Ibrahim has made for him
 ‘The lady
’ He looks at Ron and then at Ibrahim
 Ibrahim helps him out
‘Which lady
 Ron
’
‘The lady
 Ib
 The one who comes and talks to us
 The woman copper
’
‘Oh yes!’ says Ibrahim
 ‘PC De Freitas! She often comes to talk to us
 Detective Chief Inspector
 Window locks
 Do you know her
’
‘Of course
 Yes
 she is one of my team
’ Chris is trying to remember if the young PC with the non-existent shoelaces was Donna De Freitas
 He was fairly sure she was
 She’d come from the Met and no one knew why
 ‘We work very closely together
’
‘So she is part of the investigation
 This is excellent news
’ Ibrahim beams
 ‘We love PC De Freitas here
’
‘Well
 she’s not officially part of the investigation team
 Mr Arif
’ says Chris
 ‘She’s on other important duties
 Catching criminals and … so on
’
Ron and Ibrahim don’t say a word
 they just look expectantly at Chris
‘But it is a terrific idea
 I would love her to be on the team
’ says Chris
 trying to work out who he would need to speak to
 Surely someone owed him a favour
‘She is a fine officer
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘She does you credit
’
Ibrahim becomes serious again and turns to Ron
‘So
 if the handsome detective here and our friend PC De Freitas came to talk to you together
 Would you be happy
 Ron
’
Ron takes his first sip of tea
‘That’d be perfect
 Ib
 I’d like that
 I’ll talk to Jason too
’
‘Jason
’ asks Chris
 on alert
‘Do you like boxing
 son
’ asks Ron
Chris nods
 ‘Very much
 Mr Ritchie
’
‘My boy is a boxer
 Jason
’
‘I know
 sir
’ says Chris
 ‘You must be very proud
’
‘Only
 he was with me
 so he should be here
 He saw the row too
’
Chris nods
 Well
 that was very interesting
 The trip has not been wasted
 ‘Well
 I’m sure I can come back and talk to you both
’
‘And you’ll bring PC De Freitas with you
 How wonderful!’ says Ibrahim
‘Of course
’ says Chris
 ‘Whatever gets us to the truth
’
20
Joyce
So it seems we are investigating a murder
 And
 better still
 I have been in a police interview room
 This diary is bringing me luck
It was interesting watching Elizabeth in action
 She is very impressive
 Very calm
 I wonder if we would have got along if we’d met thirty years ago
 Probably not
 we are from different worlds
 But this place brings people together
I do hope I’ll be of some help to Elizabeth in the investigation
 Help to catch Tony Curran’s killer
 Perhaps I will
 in my own way
I think that if I have a special skill
 it is that I am often overlooked
 Is that the word
 Underestimated perhaps
Coopers Chase is full of the great and the good
 people who have done something or other with their lives
 It’s really a lot of fun
 There’s someone who helped design the Channel Tunnel
 someone who has a disease named after them and someone who was the ambassador to Paraguay or Uruguay
 You know the type
And me
 Joyce Meadowcroft
 What do they make of me
 I wonder
 Harmless
 certainly
 Chatty
 Guilty
 I’m afraid
 But I think they know
 deep down
 that I’m not one of them
 A nurse
 not a doctor
 not that anyone would say that to my face
 They know that Joanna bought my flat here
 Joanna is one of them
 Me
 not so much
And yet
 if there’s a row at Catering Committee
 or if there’s a problem with the lake pumps
 or if
 as happened very recently
 one resident’s dog impregnates another and all hell breaks loose
 then who is there to fix it
 Joyce Meadowcroft
I am very happy to listen to the grandstanding
 watch the chests puffing out
 hear the furious threats of legal action and wait for them to blow themselves out
 Then I step in and suggest that maybe there’s a way through
 and perhaps there is a compromise to be reached
 and perhaps dogs will be dogs
 Nobody here feels threatened by me
 nobody sees me as a rival
 I’m just Joyce
 gentle
 chatty Joyce
 always has her nose in everything
So everyone calms down through me
 Quiet
 sensible
 Joyce
 There is no more shouting and the problem is fixed
 more often than not in a way that advantages me
 Which is something no one ever seems to notice
So I am very happy to be overlooked and always have been
 And I do think perhaps that will be helpful in this investigation
 Everyone can look at Elizabeth and I’ll just get on with being me
The ‘Meadowcroft’
 by the way
 is from my late husband
 Gerry
 and I have always liked it
 I had many reasons to marry Gerry and his surname was another to add to a long list
 A friend of mine from nursing married a Bumstead
 Barbara Bumstead
 I think I might have found an excuse and called it off
What a day! I think I’ll watch an old Prime Suspect and then bed
Whatever Elizabeth needs me to do next
 I’ll be ready
21
It is another beautiful morning
Bogdan Jankowski is sitting on a swing chair on Ian Ventham’s patio and is taking some time to think things through
Tony Curran has been murdered
 Someone broke into his home and killed him
 There were plenty of suspects and Bogdan is going over a few of them in his head
 Thinking about reasons they might have for wanting Tony Curran dead
Everyone seems shocked by Tony’s death
 but nothing surprises Bogdan
 People died all the time of all sorts of things
 His father had fallen from a dam
 near Krakow
 when Bogdan was a child
 Or jumped
 or was pushed
 it didn’t matter
 It didn’t change the fact that he had died
 Something will always get you in the end
Ian’s garden is not to Bogdan’s taste
 The lawn
 which stretches down to a line of trees in the far distance
 is orderly and English and striped
 Down towards the trees
 off to the left
 there is a pond
 Ian Ventham calls it a lake
 but Bogdan knows lakes
 It has a small wooden bridge crossing its far end as it narrows
 Children would love it
 but Bogdan has never seen children in this garden
Ian had bought a family of ducks
 but foxes killed the ducks and then a guy Bogdan knew from the pub had killed the foxes
 Ian didn’t buy any more ducks after that
 because what would be the point
 There will always be foxes
 Sometimes wild ducks still visited
 Good luck to them
 was Bogdan’s view
The swimming pool is directly on Bogdan’s right
 You could take a few steps down from the patio and dive straight in
 Bogdan had tiled the swimming pool
 Bogdan had painted the little bridge duck-egg blue and Bogdan had laid the patio he was sitting on
Ian had come good on his offer and had asked him to oversee the building of the Woodlands development
 So he was taking over from Tony
 which some people might now see as bad luck
 a jinx perhaps
 But to Bogdan it was just something that was happening
 and he would do it as well as he was able
 Good money
 The money doesn’t really interest Bogdan
 but the challenge does
 And he likes being around the village
 he likes the people
Bogdan had seen all the plans now
 studied everything
 They were complicated at first but
 once you’d seen the patterns
 simple enough
 Bogdan had enjoyed working on smaller jobs for Ian Ventham
 he had liked the order of it
 but he understands that things change and that he needs to step up
Bogdan’s mother had died when he was nineteen
 She had come into some money when Bogdan’s father had died
 From somewhere
 it hadn’t been a time for details
 The money paid for Bogdan to take up a place at the Technical University in Krakow
 to study engineering
 And that’s where he had been when his mother suffered a stroke and collapsed at home
 If he had still been at home then he would have saved her
 but he wasn’t
 and so he didn’t
Bogdan came home
 buried his mother and left for England the next day
 Nearly twenty years later he is looking at a stupid lawn
Bogdan is thinking that he will maybe close his eyes for a moment when
 from the other side of the house
 comes the deep sound of the front-door chimes
 A rare visitor to this big
 quiet house
 and the reason Ian has asked Bogdan to be here today
 Ian slides back the patio door of his study
‘Bogdan
 Door
’
‘Yes
 of course
’ Bogdan gets to his feet
 He goes in via the conservatory he designed
 through the music room he’d soundproofed and into the hallway he had once sanded in his underpants on the hottest day of the year
Whatever you needed him to do
Father Matthew Mackie is regretting asking his cabbie to drop him at the bottom of the drive
 It had been quite the walk from the front gates to the front door
 He fans himself a little with his file
 then
 quickly using the camera on his phone to check his dog collar is straight
 rings the bell
 He is relieved to hear noises from within the house
 because you never know
 even when you’ve made arrangements
 He was happy to meet here
 it makes things easier all round
He hears footsteps on a wooden floor and the door is opened by a broad
 shaven-headed man
 He wears a tight
 white T-shirt and he has a cross tattooed on one forearm and three names on the other
‘Father
’ says the man
 Good news
 a Catholic
 And
 judging by the accent
 Polish
‘Dzień dobry
’ says Father Mackie
The man smiles back
 ‘Dzień dobry
 dzień dobry
’
‘I have an appointment to see Mr Ventham
 Matthew Mackie
’
The man takes his hand and shakes it
 ‘Bogdan Jankowski
 Come in please
 Father
’
‘We understand
 believe me
 that you have no legal imperative to help us
’ says Father Matthew Mackie
 ‘We disagree with the council’s ruling
 of course
 but we must accept it
’
Mike Griffin from the Planning Committee had done his job well
 thinks Ian
 Feel free to dig up the graveyard
 Ian
 he’d said
 be our guest
 Mike Griffin is addicted to online casinos and long may that continue
‘However
 I do think you have a moral obligation to leave the Garden of Eternal Rest
 the graveyard
 exactly where it is
’ continues Father Mackie
 ‘And I wanted to meet you face to face
 man to man and see if we can come to a compromise
’
Ian Ventham listens closely
 but
 in honesty
 is really thinking about how clever he is
 He is the cleverest person he knows
 that’s for certain
 That’s how he gets what he wants
 It feels almost unfair sometimes
 He’s not even one step ahead of you
 he’s on an entirely different path
Karen Playfair had been an easy one
 If he can’t persuade Gordon Playfair to sell his land
 then he knows she will
 Dads and daughters
 And she’d see a chunk of the money
 surely
 An old man can only turn down a seven-figure sum for a big hill for so long
 Ian would always find a way
But Father Mackie is trickier than Karen Playfair
 he sees that
 Priests weren’t like divorcees in their early fifties who could stand to lose a few pounds
 were they
 You had to pretend to have some respect
 and maybe you actually should have some respect
 After all
 what if they were right
 Open mind
 Which was another example of cleverness being useful
That’s why Ian has asked Bogdan to join them
 He knows this lot like to stick together
 and quite right
 who doesn’t
 He realizes he should probably speak
‘We’re only moving the bodies
 Father
’ says Ian
 ‘It will be done with the greatest of care and the greatest of respect
’
Ian knows that this is not strictly true
 Legally he had had to put the job out for public tender
 Three bids had come in
 One was from the University of Kent Forensic Anthropology Department
 who would certainly do the job with the greatest care and respect
 One was from a firm of ‘Cemetery Specialists’ in Rye
 who had recently moved thirty graves from the site of a new Pets at Home and included pictures of solemn men and women in dark blue overalls
 digging out graves by hand
 The last was from a company set up two months ago by Ian himself
 with a funeral director from Brighton he had met playing golf and Sue Banbury from Ian’s village
 who rented out diggers
 That final pitch was extremely competitive and had won the business
 Ian had looked into the excavation of cemeteries online and it wasn’t rocket science
‘Some of these graves are nearly one hundred and fifty years old
 Mr Ventham
’ says Father Mackie
‘Call me Ian
’ says Ian
Ian hadn’t strictly needed to have this meeting
 but he feels it’s better to be safe than sorry
 A lot of the residents can get quite ‘churchy’ when it suits them and he wouldn’t want Father Mackie stirring up trouble
 People get funny about corpses
 So hear the man out
 reassure him
 send him happily on his way
 Donate to something
 There’s a thought to keep in the back pocket
‘The company you’ve employed to relocate the cemetery
’ Mackie looks at his file
 ‘Angels in Transit – the Cremoval Specialists
 they know what they’re going to find
 I hope
 There won’t be many intact coffins
 Ian
 just bones
 And not skeletons
 loose bones
 broken down
 scattered
 half-rotted
 sunk through the earth
 And every single fragment of every bone
 in every single grave
 needs to be found
 needs to be documented and needs to be respected
 That’s basic decency
 but don’t forget that it is also the law
’
Ian nods
 though he is actually wondering if it is possible to paint a digger black
 Sue will know
‘I am here today
’ continues Father Mackie
 ‘to ask you to think again
 to leave these ladies where they are
 to leave them in peace
 Man to man
 I don’t know what it would cost you to do that
 that’s your business
 But you have to understand
 as a man of God
 that it’s my business too
 I don’t want these women moved
’
‘Matthew
 I appreciate you coming to see us
’ says Ian
 ‘And I see what you’re saying about angels
 Souls in torment et cetera
 if I’m reading you right
 But you said it yourself
 all we’ll find now is bones
 That’s all there is
 And you can choose to be superstitious
 or religious in your case
 I see that
 but I can choose not to be
 Now
 we’ll take care of the bones
 and I’m happy for you to be there and watch the lot if that’s what floats your boat
 But I want to move the cemetery
 I’m allowed to move the cemetery and I’m going to move the cemetery
 If that makes me whatever I am then so be it
 Bones don’t mind where they are
’
‘If I can’t change your mind then I will make this as difficult as I possibly can for you
 I need you to know that
’ says Father Mackie
‘Join the queue
 Father
’ says Ian
 ‘I’ve got the RSPCA up in arms about badgers
 I’ve got the Kent Forestry Something banging on about protected trees
 With you
 it’s nuns
 I’ve got to comply with EU regulations on heat emissions
 on light pollution
 on bathroom fittings and a hundred other things
 even though I seem to remember we voted to leave
 I’ve got residents bleating about benches
 I’ve got English Heritage telling me my bricks don’t qualify as sustainable and the cheapest cement guy in the entire south of England has just gone to prison for VAT fraud
 You are not my biggest problem
 Father
 not even close
’
Ian finally draws breath
‘Also
 Tony died
 so is difficult time for everyone
’ adds Bogdan
 crossing himself
‘Yeah
 yep
 Also
 Tony died
 Difficult time
’ agrees Ian
Father Mackie turns to Bogdan
 now he has broken his silence
‘And what do you think
 my son
 About moving the Garden of Eternal Rest
 You don’t think we’re disturbing souls
 You don’t think there will be penance for this
’
‘Father
 I think God watches over everything and judges everything
’ says Bogdan
 ‘But I think bones is bones
’
22
Joyce is having her hair cut
Anthony comes in every Thursday and Friday and appointments at his mobile salon are like gold dust
 Joyce always books the first appointment
 because that’s when you get the best stories
Elizabeth knows this and so is sitting outside by the open doorway
 Waiting and listening
 She could just walk in
 but waiting and listening are old habits she can’t break
 In a lifetime of listening you pick up all sorts
 She looks at her watch
 If Joyce isn’t out in five minutes she will make her presence known
‘One day I’m just going to dye the whole thing
 Joyce
’ says Anthony
 ‘Send you out of here bright pink
’
Joyce giggles
‘You’d look like Nicki Minaj
 You know Nicki Minaj
 Joyce
’
‘No
 but I like the sound of her
’ says Joyce
‘What do we think about this fella they killed
’ asks Anthony
 ‘Curran
 I’ve seen him round here
’
‘Well
 it’s very sad
 obviously
’ says Joyce
‘They shot him
 that’s what I heard
’ says Anthony
 ‘I wonder what he’d done
’
‘I think he was bludgeoned to death
 Anthony
’ says Joyce
‘Bludgeoned
 was he
 You really do have lovely hair
 Joyce
 You have to promise you’ll leave it to me in your will
’
Outside
 Elizabeth rolls her eyes
‘I heard they gunned him down on the seafront
’ says Anthony
 ‘Three guys on motorbikes
’
‘No
 just bludgeoned in his kitchen
 apparently
’ says Joyce
 ‘No motorbikes
’
‘Who’d do that
’ says Anthony
 ‘Bludgeon someone in their kitchen
’
Who indeed
 thinks Elizabeth
 and looks at her watch again
‘I bet he had a lovely kitchen too
’ says Anthony
 ‘What a shame
 I always had a bit of a thing for him
 Like you could tell he was a wrong ’un
 but you still would
’
‘Well
 we’re agreed there
 Anthony
’ says Joyce
‘I hope they catch whoever did it
’
‘I’m sure they will
’ says Joyce
 and takes a sip of her tea
Elizabeth decides enough is enough
 stands and walks into the room
 Anthony turns and sees her
‘Ooh
 here she is
 Dusty Springfield
’
‘Good morning
 Anthony
 I’m afraid you’re going to have to release Joyce
 I need her
’
Joyce claps her hands
23
Joyce
So that was a day I wasn’t expecting when I was having my muesli this morning
 First the nun business and now this
If you think I have muesli every morning you’ve got the wrong idea
 but this morning I did and
 as things turned out
 I was glad of the energy
 It has gone 10 p
m
 now and I have only just put my things down
 At least I had a snooze on the train home
I was having my hair cut this morning
 with Anthony
 We were nearly done and were just having a lovely gossip when who should arrive but Elizabeth
 With a tote bag and a flask
 both of which were out of character
 She told me a taxi was on its way and to get ready for a day out
 I have learned to be spontaneous since I moved to Coopers Chase
 so I didn’t bat an eyelid
 I asked her where we were going
 so I would have an idea about the weather etc
 and she said London
 which surprised me
 but explained the flask
 I know exactly how cold London can be
 so I popped home and put on a nice coat
 And thank goodness I did!
We still use the Robertsbridge taxis
 even though they once took Ron’s granddaughter to the wrong station
 and to their credit they have got better
 The driver
 Hamed
 was Somalian
 and Somalia sounds very beautiful
 Surprise
 surprise
 Elizabeth has been there and they had a right old chat
 Hamed has six children and the eldest is a GP in Chislehurst
 if you know it
 I once went to a car boot there
 so was at least able to chip in
All this time Elizabeth was waiting for me to ask where we were going
 but I didn’t crack
 She likes to be in charge and
 don’t get me wrong
 I like her to be in charge too
 but it doesn’t harm to make your presence felt every now and again
 I think she rubs off on me
 and in a good way
 I have never really thought that I was a pushover
 but the more time I spend with Elizabeth
 the more I think I probably am
 Maybe if I’d had Elizabeth’s spirit then I would have been to Somalia too
 That’s just an example of what I mean
We got on the train at Robertsbridge (the 9
51 stopper) and she’d cracked by Tunbridge Wells and let me in on it
 We were off to see Joanna
Joanna! My little girl! You can imagine my questions
 Elizabeth had me back exactly where she wanted me
So why were we going to see Joanna
 Well
 this is what it seems had transpired
Elizabeth explained
 in that way she has that makes everything sound so reasonable
 that we knew as much as the police did about many things in this case
 which was a good thing for everyone
 However
 it would also be good if there were areas where we knew more than the police
 In case we needed to ‘trade’ at any point
 This might be useful
 according to Elizabeth
 because Donna is
 unfortunately
 a bit too canny to tell us everything
 After all
 who are we
The big gap
 the way Elizabeth would have it
 was the financial records of Ian Ventham’s companies
 Might there be a useful connection between Ventham and Tony Curran there
 A reason for their row
 A motive for murder
 It was important we found out
To this end
 Elizabeth had
 of course
 acquired detailed financial records of Ian Ventham’s companies
 By hook or
 more likely
 by crook
 It was all in a big
 blue file
 hence the tote bag
 which she put on the empty seat beside her
 I haven’t mentioned it yet
 but we were travelling First Class
 I kept hoping someone would ask to see my ticket
 but no one did
Elizabeth had taken a look through all the financial bumf and couldn’t make head or tail of it
 She needed someone to take a look and tell her what was what
 Was there anything out of the ordinary
 Anything we might poke our noses into when we had a spare moment
 Hidden in the records would be leads
 of that Elizabeth was sure
 But hidden where
I asked if the same person who had found her the records in the first place might be the man for the job
 Elizabeth had said that unfortunately this person had owed her one favour
 not two
 She also said she was surprised I had said ‘man’ for the job
 given my politics
 She was right
 it was not best practice
 but I told her that I bet it was a man all the same and she confirmed that it was
Somewhere around Orpington I in turn cracked and asked why Joanna
 Well
 Elizabeth gave her reasons
 We needed someone up to speed on modern business accounting and who knows how to value companies
 both of which Joanna
 apparently
 is
 Was Ventham in trouble
 Did he owe money
 Are there any further property developments on the horizon
 Are they funded
 We needed someone we could trust absolutely and Elizabeth was spot on about Joanna here
 Joanna is many things
 but she won’t let you down over a secret
 Finally
 we needed someone we could have quick access to and who owed us a favour
 I asked Elizabeth what favour Joanna owed us and she said the universal guilt of a child who doesn’t see their mum often enough
 She had Joanna pegged there too
It boiled down
 Elizabeth said
 to needing someone ‘forensic
 loyal and nearby’
Anyway
 she had emailed Joanna and not taken no for an answer
 She told Joanna not to discuss it with me
 so it would be a nice surprise
 and here we were
This all looks convincing written down
 but then Elizabeth always has the knack of sounding convincing
 I didn’t buy it for a moment
 though
 I don’t doubt she could have found many better people for the job
 You want the truth
 I think Elizabeth just wanted to meet Joanna
Which
 by the way
 was fine by me
 It was a chance to see Joanna and a chance to show her off to Elizabeth
 And all without the embarrassment of trying to arrange it myself
 One way or another
 if I arrange it
 I always get something wrong and Joanna gets exasperated
Also
 today I wouldn’t be talking to Joanna about her job
 or her new boyfriend or the new house (in Putney
 I haven’t been
 but she’s sent me pictures and there is talk of Christmas)
 I would be talking about a murder
 Try acting like a cool teenager when someone has been murdered
 Good luck
 darling
 as they say
We arrived at Charing Cross fourteen minutes late due to ‘the slow running of this service’
 which Elizabeth had a good mutter about
 I didn’t need the loo on the train
 which was a blessing
 Last time I had been in London was for Jersey Boys with the gang
 which was a while ago now
 We used to go three or four times a year if we could
 There were four of us
 We would do a matinee and be back on the train before rush hour
 In Marks they do a gin and tonic in a can
 if you’ve ever had it
 We would drink them on the train home and giggle ourselves silly
 The gang has all gone now
 Two cancers and a stroke
 We hadn’t known that Jersey Boys would be our last trip
 You always know when it’s your first time
 don’t you
 But you rarely know when it’s your final time
 Anyway
 I wish I had kept the programme
We took a black cab (what else
) and off we set to Mayfair
 When we were on Curzon Street
 Elizabeth pointed out an office where she used to work
 It had been closed down in the 1980s for efficiencies
I have been to Joanna’s offices before
 when they first moved in
 but they have redecorated since then
 There is a table tennis table and you can just help yourself to drinks
 There is also a lift where you just say the number
 instead of pressing a button
 Not for me
 but very swish all the same
I know I sometimes go on about her
 but really
 it was so lovely to see Joanna
 She even gave me a proper hug
 because we were in company
 Elizabeth then excused herself to use the bathroom (I had gone at Charing Cross
 in case you were thinking I was superhuman)
 The second she was out of earshot
 Joanna beamed
‘Mum! A murder
’ she said
 Or words to that effect
 She looked like the child I remembered from long ago
‘He was bludgeoned
 JoJo
 Of all things
’ I replied
 These were my exact words and I think the fact she didn’t immediately screw up her face and tell me not to call her ‘JoJo’ speaks volumes
 (On a side note
 I could feel and see that she was a bit too thin
 so I don’t think her new man is good for her
 I almost took advantage and said something
 but I thought
 don’t push your luck
 Joyce
)
We were in a boardroom and the table was made out of the wing of an aeroplane
 I knew not to make a thing of it in front of Joanna
 but it was really something
 I sat there as if I saw aeroplane tables every day of the week
Elizabeth had emailed all the files over and Joanna had given them all to Cornelius
 who works for her
 Cornelius is American
 by the way
 in case you were wondering about his name
 He asked Elizabeth where she had got all the documents and she said ‘Companies House’
 and he said these are not the sort of documents you can get at Companies House and she said that
 well
 she wouldn’t know about that sort of thing
 she was just a seventy-six-year-old woman
I’ve gone on too long
 The long and short was that Ventham’s companies were in very good shape
 He knew what he was doing
 Though Cornelius had found out two very interesting things
 which we’ll be telling the police about when they come and visit
 They’ve added it all to Elizabeth’s big blue file
Joanna was funny and bright and engaging and all the things I had worried that she’d lost
 There they all were
 Perhaps she had just lost them with me
I have talked to Elizabeth about Joanna before
 How I feel we’re not as close as we should be
 as other mothers and daughters seem to be
 Elizabeth has a way of making you want to tell the truth
 She knew I had been a bit sad
 I hadn’t thought about it until now
 but I wonder if the whole trip hadn’t been for my benefit
 Really
 an awful lot of people could have told us what Cornelius told us
 So
 perhaps
 I don’t know
As we left
 Joanna said she would have to come down next weekend for a proper gossip
 I told her I would like that very much and that we could do a trip into Fairhaven
 which she said she would love
 I asked if the new man might come down with her and she gave a little laugh and said no
 That’s my girl
We could have got another black cab straight back to the station
 but Elizabeth wanted to have a stroll and so we did
 I don’t know if you know Mayfair – there are no shops you would actually buy anything in
 but it was very pleasant
 We stopped for coffee in a Costa
 It was in a beautiful building
 which Elizabeth said used to be a pub where she and a lot of her colleagues would drink
 We stayed there for a while and talked about what we’d learned
If today was anything to go by
 this whole murder investigation is going to be the most enormous fun
 It has been a long day
 and whether it has got us any closer to catching Tony Curran’s killer
 I’ll let you decide
I think Joanna saw a different side to me today
 Or maybe I saw a different side to myself through her eyes
 Either way
 it was very pleasant
 Also
 next time I’ll tell you about Cornelius
 who we liked
The village is nearly dark now
 In life you have to learn to count the good days
 You have to tuck them in your pocket and carry them around with you
 So I’m putting today in my pocket and I’m off to bed
I will just finish by saying that
 back at Charing Cross
 I nipped into Marks and bought a couple of gin and tonics in a can
 Elizabeth and I drank them on the train home
24
With the lights of the village turning out
 Elizabeth opens up her appointments diary and attempts today’s question
‘WHAT WAS THE REGISTRATION NUMBER OF GWEN TALBOT’S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW’S NEW CAR
’
She approves of this question
 Not the make of the car
 that was too easy
 Not the colour
 that could be guessed
 and guessing proved nothing
 but the registration number
 Something that required genuine recall
As she has done so often before
 in a different life
 usually in a different country and a different century
 Elizabeth shuts her eyes and zooms in
 She sees it immediately
 or does she hear it
 It is both
 her brain is telling her what she sees
JL17 BCH
She traces a finger down the page and reads the correct answer
 She is spot on
 Elizabeth shuts the diary
 She’ll write the next question later
 she already has a nice idea
For the record
 the car was a blue Lexus
 Gwen Talbot’s daughter-in-law having done well for herself in bespoke yacht insurance
 As for the daughter-in-law’s name
 well
 that remained a mystery
 Elizabeth had only been introduced to her once and had not quite caught it
 She was confident that it was just a hearing issue and not a memory issue
Memory was the bogeyman that stalked Coopers Chase
 Forgetfulness
 absent-mindedness
 muddling up names
What did I come in here for
 The grandchildren would giggle at you
 The sons and daughters would joke too
 but keep a watchful eye
 Every so often you would wake at night in cold dread
 Of all the things to lose
 to lose one’s mind
 Let them take a leg or a lung
 let them take anything before they take that
 Before you became ‘Poor Rosemary’
 or ‘Poor Frank’
 catching the last glimpses of the sun and seeing them for what they were
 Before there were no more trips
 no more games
 no more Murder Clubs
 Before there was no more you
Almost certainly you mixed up your daughter’s and granddaughter’s names because you were thinking about the potatoes
 but who knows
 That was the tightrope
So every day Elizabeth opens her diary to a date two weeks ahead and writes herself a question
 And every day she answers a question she set herself two weeks ago
 This is her early warning system
 This is her team of scientists poring over seismology graphs
 If there is going to be an earthquake
 Elizabeth will be the first to know about it
Elizabeth walks into the living room
 A number plate
 from a fortnight ago
 is a real test and she is pleased with herself
 Stephen is on the sofa
 lost in concentration
 This morning
 before her trip to London with Joyce
 they had been talking about Stephen’s daughter
 Emily
 Stephen is worried about her and thinks she is getting too thin
 Elizabeth disagreed
 but
 all the same
 Stephen wished Emily would visit more often
 just so they could keep an eye on her
 Elizabeth agreed that was reasonable and said she’d talk to Emily
However
 Emily is not Stephen’s daughter
 Stephen has no children
 Emily was Stephen’s first wife and had died nearly twenty-five years ago
Stephen is an expert in Middle-Eastern Art
 Perhaps the expert if you were talking about British academics
 He had lived in Tehran and Beirut in the sixties and seventies and many years later would go back
 to track down looted masterpieces for once-wealthy west-London exiles
 Elizabeth had briefly been in Beirut in the early seventies
 but their paths had not actually crossed until 2004
 when Stephen had picked up a glove she had dropped outside a bookshop in Chipping Norton
 Six months later they were married
Elizabeth knocks the kettle on
 Stephen still writes every day
 sometimes for hours
 He has an academic agent in London
 whom he says he must get up to see soon
 Stephen keeps his work safely locked up
 but
 of course
 nothing is safely locked up from Elizabeth and she reads it from time to time
 Sometimes it is just a piece copied from his newspaper
 repeated over and over
 but most often it is stories about Emily
 or for Emily
 All in the most beautiful handwriting
There will be no more trains up to London for Stephen
 to have lunch with his agent or to see exhibitions
 or just look up a little something at the British Library
 Stephen is on the brink
 He is over the brink
 if Elizabeth is honest with herself
 She is choosing to manage the situation
 She medicates him as best she can
 Sedation
 to be truthful
 With her pills and his
 Stephen never wakes in the night
The kettle now boiled
 Elizabeth makes two cups of tea
 PC De Freitas and her DCI are coming to see them soon
 That had all worked out very nicely
 but she still has some thinking to do
 After today’s trip with Joyce
 she now has some information to hand to the police and she would like their information in return
 They are really going to have to do a number on Donna and her boss
 though
 She has a few thoughts
Stephen never cooks
 so Elizabeth knows the place won’t burn down while she’s out
 He never goes to the shop
 or the restaurant
 or the pool
 so there won’t be an incident
 Sometimes she will come home to evidence of a poorly concealed flood and sometimes there is emergency washing
 but no matter
Elizabeth is keeping Stephen to herself for as long as she can
 At some point he will have a fall
 or cough up blood
 and he will be exposed to a doctor who won’t be fooled
 and that will be that
 and off he will go
Elizabeth grinds the temazepam into Stephen’s tea
 Then adds milk
 Her mother would have had rules on the etiquette of that
 Temazepam before milk
 or milk before temazepam
 She smiles
 this is a joke Stephen would have enjoyed
 Would Ibrahim like it
 Joyce
 She supposed no one would
Sometimes they still play chess
 Elizabeth once spent a month in a safe house somewhere near the Polish–West German border
 babysitting the Russian chess grandmaster and later defector
 Yuri Tsetovich
 She remembers him crying tears of joy when he saw how well she played
 Elizabeth had lost none of her skill
 but Stephen beats her every time
 and with an elegance that makes her swoon
 Though they are playing less and less now she realizes
 Perhaps they have played their last game
 Has Stephen captured his last king
 Please
 no
Elizabeth gives Stephen his tea and kisses him on the forehead
 He thanks her
Elizabeth returns to her notebook and flicks forward two weeks to write today’s question
 a fact she learned from Joanna and Cornelius today
HOW MUCH MONEY DID IAN VENTHAM MAKE FROM THE DEATH OF TONY CURRAN
She writes the answer further down the page
 £12
25 MILLION
 and closes her appointments diary for another day
25
PC Donna De Freitas had got the news the previous morning
 Report to CID
 Elizabeth was a quick worker
She had been assigned to the Tony Curran case as Chris Hudson’s ‘shadow’
 A new Kent Police initiative
 Something to do with inclusivity
 or mentoring
 or diversity
 or whatever the guy from HR in Maidstone had said when he rang her
 Whatever it was
 it meant she was sitting on a bench
 overlooking the English Channel
 while DCI Chris Hudson ate an ice cream
Chris had given her the Tony Curran file to get her up to speed
 She couldn’t believe her luck
 Donna had enjoyed the file a great deal at first
 It felt like some proper police work
 It brought back all the things she loved about south London
 Murder
 drugs
 someone who carried off a ‘no comment’ with a bit of panache
 As she read
 she felt sure she would stumble across a tiny clue that would crack open some decades-old case
 She had role-played it in her head
 ‘Sir
 I did some digging and it turns out that 29 May 1997 was a bank holiday
 which rather blows Tony Curran’s alibi don’t you think
’ Chris Hudson would look dubious
 no way has this rookie cracked the case and she would raise an eyebrow and say ‘I ran his handwriting through forensics
 sir
 and guess what
’ Chris would feign a lack of interest
 but she would know she had him
 ‘It turns out that Tony Curran was actually left-handed all along
’ Chris would blow out his cheeks
 He would have to hand it to her
None of this happened
 Donna simply read exactly what Chris had read
 a potted history of a man getting away with murder and then being murdered in his turn
 No smoking guns
 no inconsistencies
 nothing to peel back
 But she had enjoyed it nonetheless
‘That’s something you don’t get in south London
 eh
’ says Chris
 pointing to the sea with his ice cream cone
‘The sea
’ asks Donna
 making sure
‘The sea
’ agrees Chris
‘Well
 you’re right there
 sir
 There’s Streatham ponds
 but it’s not the same
’
Chris Hudson is treating her with a kindness she senses is genuine and with a respect that could only come with being good at his job
 If she was ever to work for Chris permanently
 she would have to do something about the way he dressed
 but that was a bridge that could be crossed in good time
 He really took the expression ‘plain clothes’ seriously
 Where does someone even buy shoes like that
 Was there a catalogue
‘Fancy a trip out to see Ian Ventham
’ says Chris now
 ‘Have a little chat about his argument with Tony Curran
’
Elizabeth had come good again
 She had rung Donna and given a few more details about the row that Ron
 Joyce and Jason had witnessed
 They would still have to go and visit in person
 but it was something to be going on with
‘Yes please
’ says Donna
 ‘Is it uncool to say “please” in CID
’
Chris shrugs
 ‘I’m not really the person to ask whether something is cool
 PC De Freitas
’
‘Can we fast forward to the bit where you start calling me Donna
’ says Donna
Chris looks at her
 then nods
 ‘OK
 I’ll try
 but I can’t promise anything
’
‘What are we looking for with Ventham
’ asks Donna
 ‘Motive
’
‘Exactly
 He won’t give it to us on a plate
 but if we just watch and listen
 we’ll pick a couple of things up
 Let me ask the questions though
’
‘Of course
’ says Donna
Chris finishes off his cone
 ‘Unless you really want to ask a question
’
‘OK
’ says Donna
 nodding
 ‘I probably will want to ask one
 Just to warn you
’
‘Fair enough
’ Chris nods
 then stands
 ‘Shall we
’
26
Joyce
‘Nothing ventured
 nothing gained
’ That’s what they say isn’t it
 That’s why I invited Bernard for lunch
I cooked lamb with rice
 The lamb was Waitrose
 but the rice was Lidl
 That’s the way I do it
 you honestly don’t notice the difference with the basics
 You see more and more Lidl vans here these days as people catch on
Bernard’s not the sort to notice the difference anyway
 I know he eats in the restaurant every day
 What he has for breakfast I don’t know
 but who really knows what anyone has for breakfast
 I usually have tea and toast with the local radio
 I know some people have fruit
 don’t they
 I don’t know when that came into being
 but it’s not for me
It wasn’t a date with Bernard
 don’t think that
 but I asked Elizabeth not to tell Ron and Ibrahim anyway
 because they would have a field day
 If it had been a date
 which it wasn’t
 I will say this
 This is a man who likes to talk about his late wife a lot
 I don’t mind that
 and I do understand it
 but I’d gone to quite an effort
 Anyway
 not something I should complain about
 I know
Perhaps I feel guilty because I don’t really talk about Gerry
 I suppose it’s just not how I deal with things
 I keep Gerry in a tight little ball just for me
 I think if I let him loose here
 it would overwhelm me
 and I worry he might just blow away
 I do know that’s silly
 Gerry would have enjoyed Coopers Chase
 All the committees
 It feels unfair that he missed out
Anyway
 this is exactly my point
 I feel the tears prickling
 and this isn’t the time or the place
 I’m supposed to be writing
Bernard’s wife was Indian
 which must have been very unusual back then
 and they were married for forty-seven years
 They moved in here together
 but she had a stroke and was in Willows within six months
 She died about eighteen months ago
 before I’d arrived
 From the sound of her
 I do wish I’d met her
They have one daughter
 called Sufi
 Not Sophie
 She lives in Vancouver with her partner and they come over a couple of times a year
 I wonder what would happen if Joanna moved to Vancouver
 I absolutely wouldn’t put it past her
We talked about other things too
 I don’t want to give you the wrong impression
 We discussed poor Tony Curran
 I told Bernard how excited I was that Tony Curran had been murdered
 He looked at me askance
 in a way that reminded me I can’t talk to everyone in the same way I talk to Elizabeth
 Ibrahim and Ron
 But
 between you and me and the gatepost
 Bernard looks rather handsome with an askance look on his face
He talked a little about his work
 though I am still none the wiser
 to be honest
 If you know what a chemical engineer is
 then you are a better woman than me
 Don’t get me wrong
 I know what an engineer is and I know what chemicals are
 but I can’t join the dots
 I talked a little bit about my work and told some funny stories about patients
 He laughed and
 when I told a story about a junior doctor who’d got his bits trapped in a hoover nozzle
 I saw a little twinkle in his eye
 which gave me cause for optimism
 It was nice
 I wouldn’t go further than that
 but I sensed there was more to learn about Bernard
 a gap that needs to be crossed
 I know the difference between alone and lonely
 and Bernard is lonely
 There is a cure for that
I am drawn to strays
 Gerry was a stray
 I knew it from the moment I met him
 Always joking
 always clever
 but always a stray
 needing a home
 Which is what I gave him and he gave me back so much more in return
 Oh
 Joyce
 this place would have suited that lovely man down to the ground
I’m banging on like Bernard
 aren’t I
 Do shut up
 Joyce
 There are silly
 proper tears now
 I’ll let them fall
 If you don’t cry sometimes
 you’ll end up crying all the time
Elizabeth is inviting Donna and her DCI to come to see us later
 She is planning to give them the information we found out from Joanna and Cornelius and to see what we might get in return
Because it isn’t Thursday
 Elizabeth asked if we can use my front room to meet them
 I told her it would be too small for all of us and she said that was perfect for her purposes
 Make the DCI uncomfortable and maybe he’ll give something away
 That’s her plan
 She says it’s an old work trick of hers
 though she no longer has access to all the equipment that she used to have
 Her express instruction was
 ‘No one leaves the room until we’ve made DCI Hudson tell us something we can use
’
She has asked me to bake
 I am doing a lemon drizzle
 but also a coffee and walnut
 because you never know
 I have used almond flour because they are so good with it at Anything with a Pulse and I have been looking for an opportunity
 I can tell that Ibrahim is tempted by the idea of being gluten-intolerant and this will head him off at the pass
I wonder if I should have a nap
 It is 3
15 and my cut-off point for a nap is usually 3 p
m
 otherwise I struggle to sleep later
 But it has been a busy few days
 so perhaps I have earned a bit of rule-breaking
Either way
 I will just add that coffee and walnut is Bernard’s favourite
 but you mustn’t read anything into that
27
Donna looks out of the window of the Ford Focus
 What do people see in trees
 There are just so many of them
 Trunk
 branches
 leaves
 trunk
 branches
 leaves
 we get it
 Her mind wanders
Chris has shown her the photograph left by the body
 Surely it’s a red herring though
 It must be
 If you’re Jason Ritchie
 or Bobby Tanner
 or whoever took the photo
 it’s asking for too much trouble
 It would be idiocy for any of the men to have left the photograph by the body
 A hundred different people might have murdered Tony Curran
 why do the police’s job for them and narrow it down to three
So someone else must have got hold of a copy of the photograph
 But how
Perhaps Tony Curran had had a copy
 That would make sense
 And perhaps Ian Ventham had seen it one day
 Tony showing off
 Ian had clocked it and tucked it away for future use
 A bit of misdirection to confuse the bungling cops
 From what Donna has read
 he seems the type who might try to do that
They are passing through a village
 which is a respite from the trees
 but there is still not enough concrete for Donna
 Maybe she’ll grow to love it
 Maybe there was more to life than south London
‘What are you thinking
’ asks Chris
 eyes off to the left
 trying to find the right road sign
‘I’m thinking of Atlanta Fried Chicken on Balham High Road
 And I’m thinking we should show the photo to Ian Ventham
’ says Donna
 ‘Ask him if he’s ever seen it before
’
‘Look him in the eye when he tells us he hasn’t
’ says Chris
 indicates left and turns onto a narrow country road
 ‘Good plan
’
‘I’m also thinking
 why don’t you ever iron your shirts
’ says Donna
‘So this is what it’s like to have a shadow
’ says Chris
 ‘Well
 I used to iron just the front bit
 because the rest was always under a jacket
 And then I thought
 well I’m wearing a tie too
 so why bother at all
 Does anyone really notice
’
‘Of course they notice
’ says Donna
 ‘I notice
’
‘Well
 you’re a police officer
 Donna
’ says Chris
 ‘I’ll start ironing shirts when I get a girlfriend
’
‘You won’t get a girlfriend until you start ironing your shirts
’ says Donna
‘It’s a real Catch 22 for sure
’ says Chris and turns onto a long driveway
 ‘Anyway
 I’ve always found that shirts sort of iron themselves while you’re wearing them
’
‘Have you now
’ says Donna
 as they pull up in front of Ian Ventham’s house
28
‘You can hold your breath for three minutes if you really put your mind to it
’ says Ian Ventham
 ‘It’s all about controlling your diaphragm
 The body doesn’t need as much oxygen as they say
 Look at mountain goats
 if you need proof
’
‘That makes sense
 Mr Ventham
’ says Chris
 ‘But perhaps we can get back to the photograph
’
Ian Ventham looks at the photograph again
 and shakes his head again
 ‘No
 I’m certain
 I’ve never seen it
 I recognize Tony
 of course
 God rest his soul
 and that’s the boxer
 isn’t it
’
‘Jason Ritchie
’ says Chris
‘My boxing trainer says I could have turned pro
’ says Ian
 ‘Physique plus mentality
 There’s some stuff you can’t teach
’
Chris nods again
 Donna looks around Ian Ventham’s living room
 One of the more extraordinary rooms she has ever seen
 There is a bright red grand piano
 with golden keys
 The piano stool is ebony and zebra-skin
‘I don’t suppose you and Tony had a falling out
 Mr Ventham
’ says Chris
 ‘Before he died
’
‘A falling out
’ asks Ian
‘Mmm
’ says Chris
‘Me and Tony
’ asks Ian
‘Mmm
’ repeats Chris
‘We never argued
’ says Ian
 ‘Arguing is very bad for your wellbeing
 You look at the science of it
 it thins the blood
 Thinner blood
 less energy
 Less energy
 slippery slope
’
Donna is listening to every word
 just taking it all in
 but her eyes continue to scan the room
 There is a large oil painting in a huge gold frame above the fireplace
 It is a painting of Ian
 carrying a sword
 There is a stuffed eagle in front of it
 Wings outstretched
‘Well
 we can all agree with that
’ says Chris
 ‘But what if I told you I’ve got three witnesses who saw the two of you arguing before he was killed
’
Donna watches as Ian leans forward slowly
 puts his elbows on his thighs and rests his chin on his clasped hands
 He is giving every impression of pretending to think
‘Well
 listen
’ says Ian
 taking his elbows off his thighs and spreading his hands
 ‘We had an argument
 sure
 sometimes you have to
 don’t you
 Just to release the toxins
 I guess that would explain what they saw
’
‘OK
 yes
 that would explain it
’ agrees Chris
 ‘But I wonder if I could ask what the argument was about
’
‘Of course
 sure
’ says Ian
 ‘It’s a valid question and I appreciate you asking it
 because
 when all’s said and done
 Tony died
’
‘Tony was murdered
 actually
 Shortly after the argument
’ says Donna
 looking at an emerald-encrusted skull and getting bored of being quiet
Ian nods at her
 ‘Accurate
 yep
 he was
 You have a bright future
 Well
 listen
 how much do you know about automatic sprinkler systems
’
‘As much as the next man
’ says Chris
‘I want to fit them to all the new flats
 Tony didn’t want the expense
 To me – and listen
 this is just me
 just how I do business – the safety of my clients is paramount
 And I mean paramount
 So I said this to Tony
 and he’s more laissez-faire about the whole thing
 not my style and we
 I’m not going to say “argued”
 I’m going to say we “bickered”
’
‘And that was that
’ asks Chris
‘And that was that
’ says Ian
 ‘Just sprinklers
 If you want to find me guilty of something
 find me guilty of going above and beyond as regards building safety
’
Chris nods
 then turns to Donna
 ‘I think that’s us done for now
 Mr Ventham
 Unless my colleague has any questions
’
Donna wants to ask why Ventham is lying about the row
 but that’s probably a bit much
 What should she ask
 What would Chris want her to ask
‘Just one question
 Ian
’ says Donna
 She doesn’t want to call him Mr Ventham
 ‘Where did you go when you left Coopers Chase that day
 Did you come home
 Perhaps you visited Tony Curran
 To continue discussing the sprinklers
’
‘I did neither
’ says Ian
 and seems on solid ground
 ‘I drove up the hill and met with Karen and Gordon Playfair
 they own the land up there
 They’ll vouch for me
 I’m sure
 At least Karen will
’
Chris looks at her and nods
 Her question was OK
‘You’re very beautiful
 by the way
’ says Ian to Donna
 ‘For a police officer
’
‘You’ll see how beautiful I am if I ever have to arrest you
’ says Donna
 remembering
 a moment too late
 that rolling her eyes was probably unprofessional
‘Well
 not beautiful
’ adds Ian
 ‘But attractive enough for round here
’
‘Thank you for your time
 Mr Ventham
’ says Chris
 standing
 ‘If there’s anything else we’ll be in touch
 And if you ever need to tell me that I’m beautiful
 you have my number
’
As Donna stands
 she takes a final look around the room
 The last thing she notices is Ian Ventham’s aquarium
 At the bottom of the tank is an exact scale replica of Ian Ventham’s house
 A clownfish emerges from an upstairs window as Donna and Chris make their way out
Donna’s phone pings as she and Chris reach the car
A text from Elizabeth
 Which doesn’t seem right to Donna at all
 Surely a message from Elizabeth should be delivered in Morse code
 or by an intricate series of flags
Donna smiles to herself and opens the text
 ‘The Thursday Murder Club
 asking if we could come over to Coopers Chase
 sir
 They have some information
’
‘The Thursday Murder Club
’ asks Chris
‘That’s what they call themselves
 There’s four of them
 a little gang
’
Chris nods
 ‘I’ve met Ibrahim and poor old Ron Ritchie
 Are they in this gang
’
Donna nods
 She has no idea why he said ‘poor’ Ron Ritchie
 but no doubt Elizabeth will be behind that
 somehow
 ‘Shall we go and see them
 Elizabeth says Jason Ritchie will be there
’
‘Elizabeth
’ says Chris
‘She’s their …’ Donna thinks
 ‘I don’t know what you’d say
 Whatever Marlon Brando was in The Godfather
’
‘Last time I went to Coopers Chase someone clamped the Ford Focus
’ says Chris
 ‘I was charged £150 to release it
 by a pensioner with a high-vis jacket and an adjustable spanner
 You reply to Elizabeth and you tell her we’ll visit when we decide
 not when she decides
 We’re the police
’
‘I’m not sure that Elizabeth will take no for an answer
’ says Donna
‘Well
 she’s going to have to
 Donna
’ says Chris
 ‘I’ve been in this job for nearly thirty years and I’m not going to be pushed around by four pensioners
’
‘OK
’ says Donna
 ‘I’ll let her know
’
29
It turned out that Chris had been wrong and Donna had been right
Chris Hudson finds himself jammed uncomfortably on a sofa
 with Ibrahim
 whom he has met before
 on one side
 and tiny
 chirpy
 white-haired Joyce on the other
 It is clearly a two-and-a-half-seater sofa and when Chris had been shown to it
 his assumption was that he would be sharing it with only one other person
 Then
 with a grace and swiftness he hadn’t expected from two people deep into their pensionable years
 Ibrahim and Joyce had slid in one either side of him and so here he was
 If he had known
 he would have declined the invitation and taken one of the armchairs
 now occupied by Ron Ritchie
 looking sprightlier than when they last met
 and the terrifying Elizabeth
 Who really doesn’t take no for an answer
More to the point
 he could have taken that cosy-looking IKEA recliner that Donna is virtually curled up in
 feet tucked underneath her
 without a care in the world
Could he move
 There is another seat
 a hard-backed chair
 but Joyce and Ibrahim would surely take offence
 They seem oblivious to his discomfort and the last thing he wants to do is seem churlish
 He is sitting where he is sitting because of their kindness and because he is to be the centre of attention
 He understands and appreciates that
 There is a psychology to seating arrangements that any good police officer picks up over the years
 He knows they have tried their best to make him feel important and they would be horrified to know that the effect is actually the complete opposite
Chris has just been given a cup of tea on a saucer
 yet he is so hemmed in that he fears any attempt to drink it might be physically impossible
 So here he is
 stuck
 but like a professional
 he will make the best of it
 Look at Donna though
 she’s even got a side table for her tea
 Unbelievable
 They couldn’t have made this more awkward for him if they’d tried
 Still
 stay professional
‘Shall we begin
’ says Chris
 He attempts to shift his weight forward
 but
 without realizing it
 Ibrahim has his elbow nestling against Chris’s hip and Chris is forced to settle back again
 His teacup is too full to safely hold in one hand and too hot to sip
 He would feel annoyance
 but the kindly
 attentive looks on the faces of the four residents make annoyance impossible
‘As you know
 myself and PC De Freitas
 over there in the chair
 making herself comfortable
 are investigating the murder of Tony Curran
 He’s a man I believe you all have some knowledge of
 a local builder and property developer
 As you also know
 Mr Curran tragically passed away last week
 and we have certain questions pertaining to this event
’
Chris looks at his audience
 They are nodding with such innocence
 taking it all in
 It makes him glad he’s adopted a slightly more formal way of speaking
 Saying ‘pertaining’ had been a good call
 He attempts a sip at the tea
 but it is still scalding hot and any blowing would send a wave over the brim
 It would also suggest to whoever made the tea that he would have preferred it to be less scalding
 which would look rude
Joyce has more bad news for him
 ‘We have forgotten our manners
 Detective Chief Inspector
 We haven’t offered you any cake
’ She produces a lemon drizzle
 already cut into slices and offers it across
Chris
 unable to raise a hand to say no thank you
 says ‘I won’t
 I had a big lunch
’ No such luck
‘Just try a slice
 I made it specially
’ says Joyce
 in a voice so proud that Chris has no choice
‘Go on then
’ he says
 and Joyce balances a slice of the cake on his saucer
‘So perhaps you have a suspect by now
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘Or are you only looking at Ventham
’
‘Ibrahim says it’s better than M&S lemon drizzle
’ says Joyce
‘He will have a number of suspects
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘If I know DCI Hudson
 He is very thorough
’
‘If you notice anything unusual
 that’s the almond flour
’ says Joyce
‘Is that right
 son
 You got any suspects
’ Ron asks Chris
‘Well
 it wouldn’t be …’
‘Narrowing it all down
 Bet you got forensics
’ says Ron Ritchie
 ‘I always watch CSI with Jason
 He’ll love all this
 What you got
 Fingerprints
 DNA
’
Chris remembers Ron as being more confused than this the other day
 ‘Well
 that’s why I’m here
 as you know
 I know you and Joyce were having a drink with your son
 Mr Ritchie
 and I think he may be joining us
 It would be good to talk to him too
’
‘He just texted
’ says Ron
 ‘He’ll be ten minutes
’
‘I bet he’d love to know the circumstances
’ says Elizabeth
‘He’d love that
’ confirms Ron
‘Well
 again
 it’s not really in my …’ says Chris
‘M&S lemon drizzle cake is oversugared
 Inspector
 that’s my opinion
’ interrupts Ibrahim
 ‘Not just my opinion either
 if you look at the discussion boards
’
Chris is struggling further now
 because the slice of cake is slightly too big for the gap between the bottom of the cup and the edge of the saucer and it is taking all his efforts to keep it balanced
 Still
 he has had a career of interviewing killers
 psychopaths
 con artists and liars of every sort
 so he ploughs on
‘We really just need to talk to Mr Ritchie and his son – and Joyce
 I think you also saw …’
‘CSI is too American for me
’ interrupts Joyce
 ‘Lewis is my favourite
 It’s ITV3
 I’ve got them backing up on my Sky Plus
 I think I’m the only one in the village who can work Sky Plus
’
‘I like the Rebus books
’ adds Ibrahim
 ‘If you know them
 Rebus is from Scotland and
 goodness me
 he has a terrible time of it
’
‘Patricia Highsmith for me
’ says Elizabeth
‘They’ll never top The Sweeney though and I’ve read all the Mark Billinghams
’ says Ron Ritchie
 again with more confidence than Chris remembers
Elizabeth
 meanwhile
 has opened a bottle of wine and fills up the glasses that have suddenly appeared in her friends’ hands
Chris cannot even attempt to sip his tea now
 as lifting it to his lips would unbalance the cake and lifting the cup off the saucer would tip the cake in the saucer’s centre and make it impossible to put the cup back down again
 He feels sweat start to trickle down his back
 reminding him of the time he interviewed a twenty-five-stone Hell’s Angels enforcer with ‘I KILL COPPERS’ tattooed around his neck
Fortunately
 Elizabeth is on hand to help him out
 ‘You look a little hemmed-in on that sofa
 Detective Chief Inspector
’
‘We normally meet in the Jigsaw Room
 you see
’ says Joyce
 ‘But it’s not Thursday and the Jigsaw Room is being used by Chat and Crochet
’
‘Chat and Crochet is a fairly new group
 Detective Chief Inspector
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Formed by members who had become disillusioned with Knit and Natter
 Too much nattering and not enough knitting
 apparently
’
‘And the main lounge is off limits
’ says Ron
 ‘The Bowls Club have got a disciplinary hearing
’
‘To do with Colin Clemence and his defence of medicinal marijuana
’ says Joyce
‘So why don’t we sit you on the upright
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘and you can talk us through the whole thing
’
‘Ooh yes
’ says Joyce
 ‘Talk slowly because it’s not really our area
 but that would be lovely
 And there’s some coffee and walnut where the lemon drizzle came from
’
Chris looks over at Donna
 She simply shrugs and holds out her palms
30
Father Matthew Mackie walks slowly up the hill
 through the avenue of trees
He had hoped Tony Curran’s death might be the end of all this
 No need for any further action on his behalf
 But he had visited Ian Ventham to put his case and he had been disappointed
 The Woodlands was continuing as planned
 The cemetery was to go
Time to conjure up a plan B
 And quickly
As the path curves to the left
 then straightens
 the Garden of Eternal Rest comes into view
 further and higher up the path
 From here Father Mackie can see the iron gates
 wide enough for a vehicle
 set into the red-brick wall
 The gates look old
 the wall looks new
 In front of the gates is a turning circle
 once for hearses and now for maintenance vehicles
He reaches the gates and pushes them open
 There is a central path
 leading to a large statue of Christ on the cross at the very far end
 He walks silently towards Christ
 through the sea of souls
 Beyond the statue
 beyond the Garden
 are tall beech trees
 reaching further up the hill to the open farmland
 Father Mackie crosses himself
 by the plinth at Christ’s feet
 No kneeling for him these days though
 arthritis and Catholicism being an uneasy mix
Matthew Mackie turns and looks back across the Garden
 squinting into the sun
 Either side of the path are the gravestones
 neat
 ordered
 symmetrical
 stretching forward in time towards the iron gates
 The oldest graves are nearest to Christ
 with the newest joining the line when their time had come
 There are around 200 bodies high on the hill
 a spot so beautiful
 so peaceful
 so perfect
 Mackie thinks it could almost make him believe in God
The first grave is dated 1874
 a Sister Margaret Bernadette and this is where Mackie eventually turns and starts his slow walk back
The older gravestones are more ornate
 more showy
 The dates of death flick slowly forward as he walks
 There are the Victorians all neatly in a line
 probably furious about Palmerston or the Boers
 Then it’s the women who sat in the convent and heard about the Wright brothers for the first time
 Then the women who nursed the blind and the broken who flooded through their gates
 as they prayed for brothers to return safely from Europe
 Then there were doctors and voters and drivers
 women who had seen both wars and still kept the faith
 the inscriptions getting easier to read now
 Then television
 rock and roll
 supermarkets
 motorways and moon landings
 Father Mackie steps off the path sometime around the 1970s
 the headstones clear and simple now
 He walks along the row
 looking at the names
 The world was changing in the most extraordinary ways
 but the rows are still neat and orderly and the names are still the same
 He reaches the side wall of the Garden
 waist height and much older than the wall at the front
 He takes in the view that hasn’t changed since 1874
 Trees
 fields
 birds
 things that were permanent and unbroken
 He walks back to the path
 clearing a leaf off one of the headstones as he passes
Father Mackie continues to walk
 until he reaches the final gravestone
 Sister Mary Byrne
 dated 14 July 2005
 What a lot Mary Byrne could tell Sister Margaret Bernadette
 just a hundred yards up the path
 So much had changed
 yet
 here at least
 so much had stayed the same
Behind Sister Mary Byrne there is room for many more graves
 but they had not been needed
 Sister Mary was the last of the line
 So here they all lay
 this sisterhood
 with the walls still around them
 the blue skies above them and the leaves still falling on the headstones
What could he do
Exiting through the gates
 Mackie turns back for a final look
 He then begins the walk downhill
 back through the avenue of trees towards Coopers Chase
A man in a suit and tie is sitting on a bench set just off the path
 enjoying the same view that Father Mackie had been enjoying
 The view that never changed
 Through wars and deaths and cars and planes
 to Wi-Fi and whatever was in the papers this morning
 There was something to be said for it
‘Father
’ acknowledges the man
 a folded copy of the Daily Express by his side
 Matthew Mackie nods back
 keeps walking and keeps thinking
31
Chris has his own chair and his own side table and he now feels like the King of the World
 He sometimes forgets the impact a police officer can have on members of the public
 The gang in front of him are looking at him with something approaching awe
 It’s nice to be taken seriously once in a while and he is happily giving them the benefit of his wisdom
‘The whole house is wired up with cameras
 pretty state-of-the-art stuff too
 but we got nothing
 On the blink
 They often are
’
Elizabeth is nodding with interest
 ‘Anyone you were expecting to see
 though
 Any suspects
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Well
 listen
 that’s not something I can really share
’ says Chris
‘So you do have a suspect
 How wonderful! What do you make of the coffee and walnut
’ says Joyce
Chris lifts a slice of coffee-and-walnut cake to his mouth and takes a bite
 Also better than M&S
 Joyce
 you wizard! Also
 it was a well known fact that there were no calories in home-made cakes
‘It’s delicious
 and look
 I didn’t say we had a suspect
 but we have persons of interest and that’s normal
’
‘“Persons of interest”
’ says Joyce
 ‘I love it when they say that
’
‘More than one
 then
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘So not just Ian Ventham
 I suppose you couldn’t possibly say
’
‘He couldn’t say
 you’re quite right
’ says Donna
 deciding enough is enough
 ‘Now leave the poor man alone
 Elizabeth
’
Chris laughs
 ‘I don’t think I need protecting here
 Donna
’
Ibrahim turns to Donna
 ‘DCI Hudson is a fine investigator
 PC De Freitas
 You are lucky to have such a good boss
’
‘Oh
 he’s a pro
’ agrees Donna
Elizabeth claps her hands
 ‘Well
 it feels like this meeting has been all give and no take
 You’ve been very kind
 Chris
 If I can call you Chris
’
‘Well
 I’ve possibly shared more than I was intending
 but I’m glad it’s been interesting
’ says Chris
‘It has
 And I think we owe you a favour in return
 You might like to take a look at this
’ Elizabeth hands Chris a bright blue binder about a foot thick
 ‘It’s a few financials on Ian Ventham
 Details of this place
 details of his relationship with Tony Curran
 Probably all nonsense
 but I’ll let you be the judge
’
There is a buzz on Joyce’s intercom and she heads off to answer it
 while Chris weighs up the binder
‘Well
 we can certainly take a look through this …’
‘I’ll look through it
 don’t panic
’ says Donna
 and gives Elizabeth a reassuring look
The door swings open and Joyce walks in with Jason Ritchie himself
 The tattoos
 that nose
 those forearms
‘Mr Ritchie
’ says Chris
 ‘We meet at last
’
32
Chris had asked Jason if he wouldn’t mind stepping outside for a photograph
 to make use of the natural light
Donna is taking the photo
 The two men are smiling happily
 arms around each other’s shoulders
 leaning against a decorative fountain shaped like a dolphin
Poor Chris
 they had really done a number on him
 Donna wonders if Chris truly understands that he’s one of the gang now
It had been useful though
 They had talked to Ron and Jason
 and to Joyce
 about what they saw
 It had been a row
 that much was clear
 None of them could shed a light on what the row was about
 but they had all thought it significant
 and as Ron and Jason were fighting men
 Chris and Donna had listened
Ron was very proud of his boy
 that much was clear
 It was natural
 of course
 but something to be careful about
 Just in case the photo left by the body hadn’t been a red herring
Donna tells Chris to move to his left a little
‘This is very kind of you
 Jason
 you must have to do it a lot
’ Chris says
 moving to his left a little
‘Price of whassname
 innit
’ agrees Jason
Donna has been doing her homework on Jason Ritchie
 Hadn’t needed much
 to be honest
 her dad had been a boxing fan
Jason has been famous since the late eighties and would now
 it seemed
 be famous for ever
 He had been the hero
 sometimes the villain
 of a series of iconic fights that captivated the whole country
 Nigel Benn
 Chris Eubank
 Michael Watson
 Steve Collins and Jason Ritchie
 It was boxing as soap opera
 Sometimes Jason was J
 R
 Ewing and other times he was Bobby
The public loved Jason Ritchie
 The brawler
 the bruiser
 tattoos running up and down each arm
 long before that was a mandatory requirement for a professional sportsman
 He was charming
 he was conventionally handsome
 becoming more and more unconventionally handsome as his career took its toll
 And
 of course
 he had his famous firebrand dad
 ‘Red Ron’
 always good for a quote
 The chat shows loved Jason too
 He accidentally knocked out Terry Wogan while showing him how he’d knocked out Steve Collins
 Donna had read that that clip still brought him in steady royalties
It never got better than the third Benn v Ritchie fight
 The body slowed a little
 the reflexes dulled
 This didn’t matter while he was still fighting the guys who were ageing alongside him
 but one by one they started retiring
 Jason had found out
 many years later
 that he’d made less money than the lot of them
 Problems with his manager
 To this day
 a lot of his money was in Estonia
 The opponents got younger
 the paydays smaller and the training harder
 until an Atlantic City night in 1998
 fighting a last-minute Venezuelan stand-in
 Jason Ritchie hit the canvas for the final time
A few years in the wilderness followed
 A few years that were never mentioned in the profiles Donna had read in the papers
 A few years where Jason made his money in a very different way
 When he was being photographed with Tony Curran and Bobby Tanner
 The years that Donna and Chris were interested in
The wilderness years didn’t last
 though
 As a new century dawned
 there was almost endless demand for a man who exuded menace and charm in equal parts
 From the lad mags to the mockney film directors to the reality shows and the adverts for gambling companies
 Jason started making more money than he ever had in the ring
 He came third in I’m a Celebrity
 he dated Alice Watts from EastEnders
 he starred in a film alongside John Travolta as a washed-up fighter and one alongside Scarlett Johansson
 also as a washed-up fighter
This new career fairly quickly followed the same trajectory as his boxing career
 however
 You only had so many days top of the bill
 These days there were no films
 fewer adverts
 and you’d see him turning up on all sorts of things
But no matter
 Jason Ritchie was now famous for ever and he appears to be grateful too
 His smile
 in front of the fountain shaped like a dolphin
 seems
 to Donna
 entirely genuine
Donna puts down the big blue file Elizabeth has given her and holds up her phone for the photo
 ‘Say cheese
 or whatever two men are comfortable saying
’
Jason starts
 ‘I duck and I dive
’ and then Chris joins him for the shouted
 ‘and I always survive!’
The two men both instinctively punch the air with their free arm and Donna takes the photo
‘That was his catchphrase
’ Chris explains to Donna
 ‘I duck and I dive and I always survive!’
Donna pockets her phone
 ‘Everyone always survives until they die
 It’s meaningless
’ She thought of adding that Rodolfo Mendoza had knocked Jason out in the third round on the East Coast
 so he hadn’t exactly survived then
 But why upset two middle-aged men unnecessarily
‘They’ll love that at Fairhaven
 Jason
 thanks
 mate
’
‘No problem
 Hope the old man was useful
’
Donna knows Chris will never show the photo to any of his colleagues
 He already has a much more interesting photograph of Jason Ritchie
‘Very useful
’ says Chris
 ‘Anyway
 what’s your thinking
 Jason
 About Tony Curran
 You must have known him a bit
 from around Fairhaven
’
‘A bit
 yeah
 I knew of him
 Not really
 though
 He had plenty of enemies
’
Chris nods
 then steals a glance at Donna
 Donna steps up and offers Jason her hand
‘Thank you so much
 Mr Ritchie
’ she says
Jason shakes Donna’s hand
 ‘My pleasure
 Could you send me a copy of the photo
 It looked a nice one
’ Jason writes down his number for Donna
 ‘I’ll head back up and see Pops
’
‘Before you head up
’ says Donna
 taking Jason’s number
 ‘You knew Tony Curran a little better than you’ve suggested
 didn’t you
 Jason
’
‘Tony Curran
 Nah
 Seen him in the pub
 know people who know him
 Heard gossip
’
‘You ever drink in the Black Bridge
 Jason
’ asks Chris
Jason misses just the slightest beat
 as if a punch has slipped through
 but won’t again
‘Near the station
 Once or twice
 Years ago
’
‘Twenty-odd years
 I’m guessing
’ says Donna
‘Maybe
’ nods Jason
 ‘Who remembers
 though
’
‘You had no dealings with Tony Curran back then
’ asks Chris
Jason shrugs
 ‘If I remember something I’ll tell you
 I’ll get up to Dad
 nice to meet you both
’
‘I saw a photo recently
 Jason
’ says Chris
 ‘Group of friends in the Black Bridge
 Bobby Tanner
 Tony Curran
 Nice one of you
 All very friendly
’
‘Lot of weirdos ask me for photos
 mate
’ says Jason
 ‘No offence
’
‘You’d recognize it
 Table covered in money
 You don’t have a copy of it
 by any chance
’ asks Chris
Jason smiles
 ‘Never seen it
’
‘You wouldn’t know who took it
’ asks Donna
‘A photo I’ve never seen
 Nope
’
‘And we’re having trouble tracking down Bobby Tanner
 Jason
’ says Chris
 ‘I don’t suppose you know where he is these days
’
Jason Ritchie purses his lips for the briefest of moments
 then shakes his head
 turns and waves over his shoulder as he goes back inside to join his dad
 Chris and Donna watch as the automatic doors slide shut behind him
 Chris looks at his watch then motions towards the car
 He walks and Donna walks alongside him
 a smile on her lips
‘That entire conversation was the most Cockney I’ve ever heard you sound
 sir
’
‘Guilty
’ admits Chris
 finally pronouncing a ‘t’
 ‘Why does Jason want a copy of that photo of us
 What’s that
 To blackmail me if he ever needs to
’
‘Simpler than that
 sir
’ says Donna
 ‘It’s to get my number
 Classic move
’
‘Either way
’ says Chris
‘Don’t worry
’ says Donna
 ‘He won’t be getting the photo
 or my number
’
‘Good-looking fella
’ says Chris
‘He’s like forty-six or something
’ says Donna
 ‘No thanks
’
Chris nods
 ‘Heaven forbid! You’d have to say he didn’t look too worried
 though
 But he’s definitely lying about not knowing Tony Curran
’
‘Could be lots of reasons
’ says Donna
‘Could be
’ agrees Chris
Hearing footsteps behind them
 they turn to see Elizabeth and Joyce hurrying after them
 Joyce has a Tupperware container with her
‘I forgot to give you this
’ says Joyce
 handing over her Tupperware
 ‘It’s the last of the lemon drizzle
 I’m afraid the coffee and walnut already has someone else’s name on it
’
Chris takes the cake
 ‘Thank you
 Joyce
 that will go to a good home
’
‘And Donna
’ says Elizabeth
 gesturing to the blue file
 ‘Do call me if your bedtime reading gets complicated
’
‘Thank you
 Elizabeth
’ says Donna
 ‘I’m sure I’ll struggle through
’
‘Here
 you should probably have my number too
’ says Elizabeth
 and hands Chris her card
 ‘We’ll have lots to chat about in the weeks ahead
 Thank you for coming to see us
 we do love visitors
’
Donna smiles as Chris virtually bows to Elizabeth and Joyce
‘It really was an education
’ says Joyce
 with a smile
 ‘And you should probably let Donna drive
 DCI Hudson
 There was an awful lot of vodka in those cakes
’
33
Elizabeth had come straight over to Willows after meeting with the police
 She makes sure that Penny has a wash and a set once a week
 Anthony
 the hairdresser
 comes to Willows at the end of his appointments and always insists on doing it for free
One day
 if Anthony ever gets into any sort of trouble
 or ever needs help
 he will discover how grateful Elizabeth is for this kindness
‘Mafia
 I heard
’ says Anthony
 gently running a soaped sponge through Penny’s hair
 ‘Tony Curran owed them money
 so they cut off his fingers and killed him
’
‘That’s an interesting theory
’ says Elizabeth
 She has a hand cupped under Penny’s neck and lifts her head
 ‘And how did the Mafia get into the house
’
‘Shot their way in
 I suppose
’ says Anthony
‘Without leaving bullet holes
’ asks Elizabeth
 Penny’s shampoo smells of rose and jasmine and Elizabeth buys it at the shop on site
 They stopped selling it for a while
 but Elizabeth paid them a visit and they changed their mind
‘Well
 that’s the Mafia for you
 Elizabeth
’ says Anthony
‘And without tripping any alarms
 Anthony
’ says John Gray
 from his usual chair
‘Have you seen Goodfellas
 John
’ says Anthony
‘If that’s a film then I won’t have
’ says John
‘There you are then
’ says Anthony
 He is now combing Penny’s hair
 ‘You’re going to need a little trim next week
 Penny darling
 Get you disco-ready
’
‘No bullet holes
 Anthony
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘No alarms
 nothing broken
 no sign of a struggle
 What does that suggest to you
’
‘Triads
’ Anthony is unplugging his curling tongs
 ‘One of these days I’m going to unplug you by mistake
 Penny
’
‘As Penny would be the first to tell you
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘It suggests that he let his killer in
 So it must have been someone he knew
’
‘Oh I love that
’ says Anthony
 ‘Someone he knew
 Of course
 You ever killed someone
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth shrugs
‘I can just picture it
’ says Anthony
 putting on his jacket
 ‘There you go
 Penny
 I’d kiss you
 but not with John in the room
 Look at those forearms
’
Elizabeth stands and hugs him
 ‘Thank you
 darling
’
‘She looks gorgeous
’ says Anthony
 ‘If I say so myself
 See you next week
 Elizabeth
 Bye
 Penny
 bye
 handsome John
’
‘Obliged
 Anthony
’ says John
As Anthony leaves
 Elizabeth sits by Penny again
 ‘Here’s another thing though
 Pen
 They took young Jason out for a photo afterwards
 I know he gets that a lot
 but something didn’t seem right
 It felt off
 Why go outside
 Joyce has one of those big picture windows
 You know
 the ones in Wordsworth
 That would be a lovely photo
’
Mentioning Joyce again
 Easier every time
‘Do you think they were asking Jason about something
 Are we missing something
 We passed him on the stairs coming back up and he was his usual charming self
 but who knows
’
Elizabeth sips some water and feels grateful
 Then feels guilty for feeling grateful
 Then feels weak for feeling guilty
 So she carries on talking to Penny
 To Penny
 or to herself
 Who knew
‘Perhaps it wasn’t Ventham at all
 Perhaps we’re just being blinded by what’s in that file
 By the twelve million
 I mean
 where was he when Curran was killed
 Do we even know
 Could he have done it
 Do the timings work
’
‘Elizabeth
 forgive me
’ says John
 ‘But have you ever watched Escape to the Country
’
Elizabeth is still not really used to John speaking
 but he does seem to be coming out of his shell recently
 ‘I don’t believe I have
 John
 no
’
John is fidgeting a little
 Something is clearly on his mind
 ‘I mean
 it’s rather good
 I’m sure it’s nonsense
 but even so
 There will be a couple on and they will be looking for a new home
’
‘In the country
 John
’
‘In the country
 as you say
 And a chap
 well sometimes it’s a woman
 will show them around some houses
 I watch it with the sound down
 because it’s not really Penny’s sort of thing
 You can really see in the eyes of the couple which one wants to move and which one is just going along with it
 For a quiet life
 you know
’
‘John
’ says Elizabeth
 leaning forward and staring straight into his eyes
 ‘I’ve never known you utter a sentence without a reason
 Where is this heading
’
‘Well
 it’s only heading here
 I suppose
’ says John
 ‘I was watching Escape to the Country
 you see
 on the day that Curran was killed and they’d just got to the end
 where they decide whether to buy the house or not
 They never do
 but that’s half the fun
 I got up and wandered out to get a Lucozade Sport from the machine and I looked out of the window
 the one at the front
 and saw Ventham’s car driving off
’
‘The Range Rover
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Yes
 the Range Rover
’ says John
 ‘Coming down the track from the top of the hill
 And I just thought I would mention it to you
 as Escape to the Country is on straight after Doctors and it finishes at three on the dot
’
‘I see
’ says Elizabeth
‘And I thought that perhaps if you knew exactly when Ventham left Coopers Chase and you knew exactly when Curran had been killed
 it might be useful
 For the investigation
’
‘Three p
m
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Mmm
 On the dot
’
‘Thank you
 John
 I think I need to send a text message
’ Elizabeth takes out her phone
‘I don’t think you’re supposed to use your mobile telephone in here
 Elizabeth
’ says John
Elizabeth gives a kindly shrug
 ‘Well
 imagine if we only ever did what we were supposed to
 John
’
‘You have a point there
 Elizabeth
’ agrees John
 and goes back to his book
34
Donna is getting ready to go out when her phone pings
 A message from Elizabeth
 She only left her a few hours ago
 It will be trouble
 for sure
 but she likes seeing the name pop up
What time was Tony Curran killed
Well
 that was short and to the point
 Donna smiles and composes a reply
Maybe ask how I am
 share a bit of gossip
 before asking for a favour
 And sign off with a kiss
 Soften me up a bit x
Donna sees the speech bubble
 showing that Elizabeth is replying
 She is taking her time
 so what will it be
 A lecture
 A reminder of why Donna is investigating a murder
 instead of measuring the depth of tyre treads in the car park at Halfords
 which is what Mark was doing today
 Perhaps it would be something in Latin
 There is a ping
How are you Donna
 Mary Lennox has just had a new great granddaughter
 but she is worried that her granddaughter has been having an affair
 because the husband has a very prominent chin and it is nowhere to be seen
 What time was Tony Curran killed
 X
Donna is choosing between lipsticks
 She wants something that doesn’t look too obvious
 while at the same time looking obvious
 She replies
I can’t tell you that
 I’m a professional
There is an immediate ping back
LOL!
LOL
 Where had Elizabeth got that from
 Two can play at that game
WTF
This has clearly foxed Elizabeth and Donna has time to look in the mirror and check her interested face
 her laughing face and her quietly seductive face before the next ping
I’m afraid I don’t know WTF
 I only discovered LOL from Joyce last week
 I’m going to assume that it doesn’t refer to the Warsaw Transit Facility
 as that was shut down in 1981 when the Russians came sniffing
Donna sends back an emoji of big eyes and an emoji of the Russian flag and then starts to floss
 Even though they say you don’t need to floss any more
 Ping!
That’s the Chinese flag
 Donna
 Just let me know the time of death
 You know we won’t tell a soul and you also know we might just come up with something useful
Donna smiles
 What harm could it do
 really
3
32
 His Fitbit broke when he fell
There is another ping
Well
 I don’t know what a Fitbit is either
 but thank you
 X
35
Joyce
The police came over today and at first I had to feel sorry for DCI Hudson
 but I think he rather enjoyed himself by the end
 Anyway
 Elizabeth gave him and Donna the file
 so we’ll see what they make of it
 Joanna’s name is not on the file anywhere
 which Elizabeth reassured me helps with ‘plausible deniability’ just in case anything we’re doing is against the law
 Which I assume it is
I asked Elizabeth to repeat the phrase ‘plausible deniability’ and I wrote it down
 She asked me why I was writing it down and I said it was because I’m writing a diary and she rolled her eyes
 Though she then asked if she was in the diary and I said of course she was and she then asked if I was using her real name
 Which I said I was
 though I’ve thought about it since and who knows with Elizabeth
 Perhaps she’s really a Jacqueline
 We tend to accept what people tell us they’re called
 No questions asked
But I’ve been thinking
 You must think I’m murder obsessed
 it’s all I’ve written about since I started this diary
 So perhaps I should tell you some other things
 Let’s talk about a few things that aren’t murder
 What can I tell you
When I was putting the hoover round after the police had gone
 Elizabeth said she thought I would get on with a Dyson
 But I said I didn’t think so
 not at my age
 But perhaps I should take the plunge
And after the hoovering we had a glass of wine
 It was a screw top
 but you don’t notice these days
 do you
 It’s just as good
When Elizabeth went home
 I asked her to give my love to Stephen and she said she would
 Then I said they should both come to dinner one night and she said that would be lovely
 But all is not right
 there
 She will tell me when she’s ready
What else that isn’t murder
Mary Lennox’s granddaughter has just had a baby
 He’s called River
 which has raised a few eyebrows
 but I rather like it
 The woman who works in the shop is getting divorced and they’ve started stocking chocolate digestives
 Karen Playfair
 from up on the hill
 is coming to give us a ‘Coopers Chase Breakfast Masterclass’ talk on computers
 The last newsletter said she’s coming to give a talk about tablets and that caused some confusion
 so they had to print an explanation this week
Apart from that
 and the murder
 all is peace and quiet
Anyway
 I see that it’s getting late
 so I will wish you a good night
 While I have been writing
 Elizabeth has sent me a message
 We are off on a road trip tomorrow
 No idea when and no idea why
 but I shall look forward to it very much
36
Donna can’t believe she is already in bed at 9
45
 She had gone on the date because
 frankly
 it was about time
 A man called Gregor had taken her to Zizzi’s
 where he had nibbled at a salad and talked her through his protein-shake regime for ninety minutes
At one point Donna had asked him who his favourite author was
 For Donna an acceptable answer would be Harlan Coben
 Kurt Vonnegut
 or any woman
 Gregor had sagely replied that he ‘didn’t believe in books’ and that ‘you only learn in this life through having experiences and keeping your mind open’
 When she then raised the thorny philosophical dilemma of whether you could both ‘keep your mind open’ and ‘not believe in books’ he had replied
 ‘Well
 I think you rather prove my point there
 Diana
’ and sipped his water in a manner that suggested great wisdom
Close to tears through boredom
 Donna had wondered where Carl was this evening
 Donna has recently taken to scrolling through the Instagram feed of her ex-boyfriend and the Instagram feed of his new girlfriend
 who appeared to be called Toyota
 It has become such a habit now
 she will sort of miss it when Carl and Toyota split up
 Which they will
 because Carl is an idiot and he’s not going to keep a hold of a girlfriend with eyebrows that great
Does Donna still love Carl
 No
 Did she ever
 if she’s being honest
 Probably not
 now she’s had time to think about it
 Does she still feel belittled by his rejection
 Yes
 that’s showing no signs of going away
 It’s sitting like a stone just under her heart
 She had arrested a shoplifter in Fairhaven last week
 and when he had struggled
 she had brought him down with a baton behind the knees
 She was aware she had hit him much harder than she should
 Sometimes you just had to hit things
Was it a mistake to get as far away from Carl as she could
 To transfer to Fairhaven in a frightened huff
 Of course it was a mistake
 It was stupid
 Donna has always been headstrong
 always acted quickly and decisively
 Which is a fine quality when you are right
 but a liability when you are wrong
 It’s great to be the fastest runner
 but not when you’re running in the wrong direction
 Meeting the Thursday Murder Club was the first good thing that had happened to Donna in a long time
 That and Tony Curran being murdered
Donna had taken a photo of herself and Gregor just after he’d finished his superfood salad
 She posted it to Instagram with the caption ‘This is what you get when you date a personal trainer!’ and added not one but two wink emojis
 The only thing men were ever jealous of was good looks
 and Carl wasn’t to know that Donna had spent much of the evening surveying the dinner table
 idly wondering how she would murder Gregor
 if she absolutely had to
 She had settled on injecting a dough ball with cyanide
 Although she later realized that there was no way she could have got Gregor to eat a carb
Talking of Gregor
 she hears the toilet flush
 She slips her clothes back on and
 as he comes back out of the bathroom
 she gives him a peck on the cheek
 There is no way she’s staying overnight in the room of a twenty-eight-year-old man who has two posters on his bedroom wall
 one of the Dalai Lama and one of a Ferrari
 It is still not 10 p
m
 and she wonders if she is allowed to text Chris Hudson and see if he fancies a quick drink
 Have a little chat about Elizabeth’s file
 the bits of it that she had understood
 Also
 she has finally just watched Narcos on Netflix and wants to discuss it with someone
 Gregor had not seen it
 Gregor didn’t watch television
 due to a long reason that Donna had quickly lost interest in
Maybe she should just head home and ring Elizabeth instead
 Talk through what she’d read in the folder
 Would 10 p
m
 be too late
 Who knew with that lot
 They had lunch at half eleven
So
 it’s either Chris
 her boss
 or Elizabeth
 her … well what exactly was Elizabeth
 The word that came to Donna’s mind first was ‘friend’
 but surely that wasn’t right
37
‘Not too late at all
 PC De Freitas
’ says Elizabeth
 nearly dropping the phone receiver in the darkness and blindly struggling to switch on the bedside light
 ‘I was just watching a Morse
’
Elizabeth manages to flick the light on
 sees the gentle rise and fall of Stephen’s ribcage
 His faithful heart beating on
‘And why are you up at this hour
 Donna
’
Donna sneaks a look at her watch
 ‘Well
 it’s quarter past ten
 Sometimes I just stay up this late
 Now
 Elizabeth
 the folder was a bit long and a bit complicated
 but I think I got some of it
’
‘Excellent
’ replies Elizabeth
 ‘I wanted it to be long and complicated enough for you to need to ring me to talk about it
’
‘I see
’ says Donna
‘It keeps me involved
 you see
 and it reminds you that we can be useful
 I wouldn’t want you to feel like we were interfering
 Donna
 but at the same time I do want to interfere
’
Donna smiles
 ‘Why don’t you take me through it
’
‘Well
 firstly
 just to note
 there are documents in that folder that would take you weeks to track down
 You’d need warrants and all sorts
 Ventham wouldn’t let you anywhere near some of them
 So
 I’m not blowing my own trumpet
 but even so
’
‘Feel free to let me know how you got hold of them
’
‘Ron found them in a skip
 Amazing what you can find
 a lucky break for us all
 Now
 do you want the headlines before bed
 You want to know why Ian Ventham might have murdered Tony Curran
’
Donna lies back on her pillow
 remembering her mum reading her bedtime stories
 She is aware that this shouldn’t feel similar
 but it does
 ‘Mmm hmm
’ she assents
‘Now
 Ventham’s business is very profitable
 very well run
 But here’s the first headline that’s of interest to us
 We discover that Tony Curran owns twenty-five per cent of Coopers Chase
’
‘I see
’ says Donna
‘But then we discover that Curran is not a partner in the new company Ventham is using for The Woodlands
’
‘The new development
 OK
 And
’
‘There is an appendix in your folder – 4c
 I think
 The Woodlands was due to be exactly the same as the rest of Coopers Chase
 seventy-five per cent Ian Ventham
 twenty-five per cent Tony Curran
 until Ventham changed his mind and cut Curran out entirely
 Now you know what question to ask next
’
‘When did Ventham change his mind
’
‘Precisely
 Well
 Ventham signed the papers to cut Curran out of the deal the day before the consultation meeting
 Which was
 of course
 the day before their mysterious row
 And the day before someone murdered Tony Curran
’
‘So Curran misses out on The Woodlands
’ says Donna
 ‘What would that have cost him
’
‘Millions
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘There are huge projections in the folder
 Curran would have been counting on an enormous payday before Ventham cut him out of the deal
 That’s the news he received from Ian Ventham the day he was murdered
’
‘Certainly enough for him to threaten Ventham
 Is that your thinking
’ asks Donna
 ‘So Curran threatens Ventham
 Ventham gets scared and kills Curran
 Gets his retaliation in first
’
‘Exactly
 And it would get even worse after the next phase of the development
 Hillcrest
 That’s what our expert says
’
‘Hillcrest
’ asks Donna
‘The real golden goose
 Buying the farmland on top of the hill
 Doubling the size of the development
’
‘And when will Hillcrest happen
’ asks Donna
‘Well that’s a sticking point for Ventham
 He doesn’t even own the land yet
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘It is still owned by the farmer
 Gordon Playfair
’
‘This is too complicated for me now
 Elizabeth
’ admits Donna
‘Forget Hillcrest for now
 and forget Gordon Playfair
 they’re red herrings
 What that folder tells you are two key things
 Firstly
 Ventham double-crossed Tony Curran
 on the day Curran died
’
‘Agreed
’
‘And secondly – listen carefully to this – Tony Curran’s shares have all reverted to Ian Ventham
’
‘Tony Curran’s shares pass back to Ian Ventham
’
‘They do
’ confirms Elizabeth
 ‘If you want to put a figure on it
 something simple to tell Chris Hudson
 our expert says Tony Curran’s death just earned Ian Ventham around twelve and a quarter million pounds
’
Donna gives a low whistle
‘Which sounds an awful lot like a motive to me
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘So I hope this is helpful
’
‘It is helpful
 Elizabeth
 I’ll let Chris know
’
‘Chris
 is it
’ says Elizabeth
‘I’ll let you get back to sleep now
 Elizabeth
 sorry for ringing so late
 And I’m grateful for what you’ve done
 And it’s cute you keep saying “our expert” instead of “Joyce’s daughter”
 Very loyal
 I promise we’ll look into it
’
‘Thank you
 Donna
 and no comment
 When you’re over next
 I would like you to meet my friend Penny
’
‘Thank you
 Elizabeth
 I’ll look forward to it
 Can I ask why you wanted to know what time Tony Curran died
’
‘Just idle curiosity
 I think Penny will like you very much
 Night
 night
 dear
’
38
The morning sun is rising in the Kent sky
‘Ibrahim
 if you keep driving at twenty-nine miles per hour
 this whole exercise will be moot
’ says Elizabeth
 her fingers drumming on the glove box
‘And if I crash on a sharp bend
 the exercise will also be moot
’ says Ibrahim
 eyes fixed on the road and intending to remain steadfast
‘Would anyone like a Mini Cheddar
’ asks Joyce
Ibrahim was tempted
 but he liked to have both hands on the wheel at all times
 Ten and two
Ron was the only one of them who had a car
 but there had still been an argument about who was going to drive
 Joyce hadn’t held a licence for thirty years and so was out immediately
 Ron had put up a token fight
 but Ibrahim knew he had lost his confidence on right-hand turns and would be secretly delighted to be voted down
 Elizabeth put up more spirited opposition
 mentioning that she still held a fully valid tank licence
 She really could play fast and loose with the Official Secrets Act at times
 But
 in the end it all came down to this
 Ibrahim was the only one who understood how the satnav worked
It had been Elizabeth’s idea
 he was happy to grant her that
 They knew
 somehow
 that Ian Ventham had left Coopers Chase at exactly 3 p
m
 and they knew that Tony Curran had been murdered at 3
32
 Ibrahim had had to explain to everyone what a Fitbit was
 And so here they were
 timing the journey in Ron’s Daihatsu
 Ibrahim knew they could have just plotted the journey on the satnav
 but he also knew no one else realized that and he had fancied the drive
 It had been a long time
So Ibrahim is behind the wheel
 Joyce and Ron are happily sharing their Mini Cheddars in the back seat
 Elizabeth has stopped drumming her fingers and is now texting someone on her phone and everyone had been to the toilet before they left
 as per his instructions
Could Ian Ventham have made it from Coopers Chase to Tony Curran’s house in time to kill him
 If he couldn’t
 then they were barking up the wrong tree
 They were about to find out
39
‘OK
 folks
 I’ll show you mine if you show me yours
’
Another early morning and Chris Hudson’s murder squad is assembled
 in various stages of dishevelment
 Chris has brought in Krispy Kremes from the garage and they are doing brisk business
 Chris goes through what he’d discovered from the Thursday Murder Club and what Donna had told him about the file
 after she’d buzzed on his door at 11 p
m
 They’d talked about it over and over and then watched the first episode of Narcos season two with a bottle of red
 Donna had invited herself over and Chris had wondered if this was just what constables were like in London these days
 You had to hand it to her
 she knew how to make a quick impression
‘Ian Ventham
 Tony Curran’s business partner
 broke some bad news to Curran less than two hours before the murder
 He was cutting him out of a development that would extend Coopers Chase
 a retirement village out near Robertsbridge
 This would have cost Curran a lot of money
 and his death has made Ventham even more money
 Over twelve million
 The two men were seen having an argument shortly before Curran returned home
 Did he threaten Ventham
 Did Ventham decide it was better to be safe than sorry and send someone round
 We know that Curran was killed at 3
32 last Tuesday
 but when did Ventham leave Coopers Chase that day
’
‘Where’s this info from
’ asks a young DI
 Kate something
‘Sources
’ says Chris
 ‘Where are we on traffic cameras
 Terry
 You’ve got Ventham’s reg number
’
Donna’s phone buzzes and she looks down at a message
Good luck at the briefing this morning
 Love
 Elizabeth x
Donna shakes her head
‘Got the number
 but nothing yet
 Still looking
’ says DI Terry Hallet
 shaven-headed
 muscles bulging from underneath a white T-shirt
 ‘There’s a lot of traffic
 It’s a fun job
’
‘That’s why you get doughnuts
 Terry
’ says Chris
 ‘Keep it up
 And where are we on our other friend in the photograph
 Bobby Tanner
’
‘They’ve talked to the police in Amsterdam
’ says Kate something
 ‘Bobby was working for some Scousers there after he did a runner
 It didn’t end well
 as far as we can tell
 and no one’s heard of him since
 No records
 no bank details
 nothing
 We’re still asking around
 to see if he’s come back under a different name
 but it was a long time ago
 there’s not many of the old faces left
’
‘It’d be nice to chat to him
 rule him out at least
 Anyone with anything positive for me
’
A junior DS puts up her hand
 She’s been sent over from Brighton and is eating carrot sticks instead of a doughnut
‘Yes
 DS Grant
’ says Chris
 taking a punt on her name
‘DS Granger
’ says DS Granger
So close
 thinks Chris
 There are too many officers on this team
‘I’ve been looking at Tony Curran’s phone records
 He gets three calls on the morning of the murder
 all from the same number
 doesn’t pick them up
 A mobile
 untraceable
 probably a burner
’
Chris nods
 ‘OK
 good work DS Granger
 email me everything you’ve got and get on to the phone company
 in case they can help
 I know they won’t
 but one of these days they will
’
‘Of course
 sir
’ says DS Granger and treats herself to a carrot baton
Donna’s phone buzzes again
We are having a little Thursday Murder Club road trip
 in case there was anything you wanted to pass on
‘OK
 gang
 let’s get back to it
 Terry
 anything from the traffic cams
 let me know straight away
 Kate
 can I team you up with DS Granger and see what you can learn about the phone calls
 And keep tracing Bobby Tanner
 wherever he is
 alive or dead
 someone must know
 Anyone who feels they’ve got nothing to do
 come and knock at my door and I’ll find something boring for you
 One way or another
 let’s get Ventham
’
There is a final buzz on Donna’s phone
PS
 my sources saw Chris buying doughnuts this morning
 You lucky thing
 Also
 Joyce says hello xx
40
Bernard Cottle finishes the Codeword puzzle in the Express and puts his pen back in the pocket of his jacket
 It is beautiful up here this morning
 On the bench
 on the hill
 Too beautiful
 a cruel trick
 played on those not still here to see it
He had seen Joyce and her friends driving off somewhere this morning
 How happy they had looked! But
 then
 Joyce seems to make everyone happy
Bernard knows he has gone too far inside himself
 Knows he is out of reach
 even to Joyce
 Bernard is not going to be saved and he doesn’t deserve to be saved
Still
 what he wouldn’t give to be in that car right now
 Looking out at the view
 as Joyce nattered away
 perhaps picking the loose thread from the cuff of his jacket
But instead he will stay here
 on the hill
 where he sits every day
 and wait for what’s to come
41
Ibrahim had wanted to drive the Daihatsu right up to Tony Curran’s front gate
 just for the purposes of absolute accuracy
 Elizabeth had told him that this was poor fieldcraft
 however
 and so they are now in a lay-by
 about 300 metres from Tony Curran’s house
 It will do
 he supposes
Ibrahim has his notebook open on the bonnet and is showing some calculations to Joyce and Elizabeth
 Ron is urinating in the woods
‘So it took us thirty-seven minutes at an average speed of twenty-seven and a half miles per hour
 give or take
 There was no traffic
 because I am very efficient at plotting routes
 I have a sixth sense
 Other people would have hit traffic
 I assure you
’
‘I will recommend you for a gallantry honour
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘As soon as we get back
 Now
 what does this mean for Ventham
’
‘Would you like the detailed answer
 or the simple answer
’ asks Ibrahim
‘The simple answer please
 Ibrahim
’ says Elizabeth without hesitation
Ibrahim pauses
 Perhaps he had phrased his question poorly
 ‘But I have prepared a detailed answer
 Elizabeth
’
Ibrahim lets this hang in the air
 until Joyce says
 ‘Well
 let’s all enjoy the detailed answer shall we
’
‘As you wish
 Joyce
’ Ibrahim claps his hands and turns over a page in his notebook
 ‘Now
 Ventham could have taken one of three routes
 He might have taken our route
 but I doubt it
 I don’t think he has my insight for road networks
 Route two
 along the A21
 looks the most obvious on the map
 it’s the straightest line
 but here our friend temporary roadworks come into play
 I spoke yesterday to a very interesting man at Kent County Council
 who says the roadworks are to do with fibre optics
 Would you like me to elaborate further on fibre optics
 Joyce
’
‘I think I’m OK
 if Elizabeth is
’ says Joyce
Ibrahim nods
 ‘Another time
 So route three
 you could take the London Road
 down past Battle Abbey
 cut across and then down the B2159
 Now
 I know what you’re thinking
 You’re thinking that seems slower
 surely
’
‘I was certainly thinking something
 but it wasn’t that
’ says Elizabeth
 Ibrahim could swear he senses impatience
 but he is going as quickly as he can
‘So
 we take our speed
 which you will remember was …
’
‘I’ve forgotten
 Ibrahim
 forgive me
’ says Joyce
‘Approximately twenty-seven point five miles per hour
 Joyce
’ says Ibrahim
 with his trademark patience
‘Of course
’ nods Joyce
‘And we will allow an extra three miles per hour for Ian Ventham’s average speed
 I was being careful
 as you know
’ Ibrahim looks at both Elizabeth and Joyce and is gratified by their quick nods
 ‘So
 I then took the liberty of aggregating his three possible routes
 dividing the answer by his average speed and subtracting a margin of error
 I have calculated the margin of error in a rather elegant way
 Take a look at my notebook and you’ll see the maths
 We take the average speed of route A and then we …’
Ibrahim stops as a noise comes from the woods
 It is Ron
 emerging and zipping himself up without a care in the world
‘Better out than in
’ says Ron
‘Ron!’ says Elizabeth
 as if greeting her oldest friend in the world
 ‘We were about to enjoy Ibrahim showing us some maths
 but I imagine you’d have little patience with that
’
‘No maths
 Ibrahim old son
’ says Ron
 ‘Could Ventham have got here on time
’
‘Well
 I can show …’
Ron waves this away
 ‘Ibrahim
 I’m seventy-five
 mate
 Could he have done it
’
42
Ian Ventham is on his treadmill
 listening to the audiobook of Richard Branson’s Screw It
 Let’s Do It
 Lessons in Life and Business
 Ian doesn’t agree with Branson’s politics
 far from it
 but you have to admire the guy
 Admire what he’s achieved
 One day Ian will write a book
 He just needs a title that rhymes and then he’ll get to work
As Ian runs
 he is thinking about the graveyard and he’s thinking about Father Mackie
 He wouldn’t want anything to get out of hand there
 In the good old days he could have sent Tony Curran round to have a quiet word with him
 But Tony’s gone and Ian is not going to dwell on that any more than Richard Branson would
 Branson would move on and so will Ian
The diggers are due to start in a week
 Get the graveyard done first
 that’s the tough bit
 like eating your vegetables
 Everything else will be a breeze
The diggers are ready to go
 the permits are signed off
 Bogdan’s lined up a couple of drivers
In fact
 thinks Ian
 in fact
 what is he waiting for
 What would Branson do
 What would the one guy he likes on Dragons’ Den do
They’d get on with it
 Screw it
 let’s do it
Ian switches off the audiobook and
 without breaking stride
 rings Bogdan
43
Joyce
So
 could Ian Ventham have killed Tony Curran
 That was today’s big question
Well
 according to Ibrahim
 and I do trust him in the area of attention to detail
 Ian Ventham would have been cutting it very fine
 but it would have been possible
 If he had left Coopers Chase at 3 p
m
 he would have arrived at Tony Curran’s house (big
 and a bit tacky
 but still nice) at 3
29
 That would have given him two minutes to get out of his car
 get into the house and hit Tony Curran with a large object
So
 Ron said that if Ian Ventham had killed Tony Curran
 then he’d done it very quickly and Elizabeth had said that that was always the best way to kill someone and that there was never any point faffing around
I asked Ibrahim if he was certain of the timings and he told me that of course he was and that he had tried to show me his workings
 but that he’d been interrupted by Ron returning from urinating
 I told him that was a shame and he perked up a bit and suggested that perhaps he could show me the workings later
 I told him that I would like that very much
 because a white lie harms no one
So
 we had a lot of fun today and it seems that Ian Ventham really could have killed Tony Curran
 He had the motive and he had the opportunity and I suppose where bludgeoning is concerned
 the means is just something big and heavy
 so that wouldn’t be beyond him either
 Lewis would have him bang to rights
What if they arrest Ventham though
 And the fun stops
Let’s see what tomorrow brings
44
Ian Ventham is having an early night
 He sets his alarm for 5 a
m
 Tomorrow is the big day
 He puts on his blackout goggles and his noise-cancelling headphones and happily drifts off
Ron shuts his eyes
 He liked it the other day
 the police coming to see them
 and he liked shouting at Ventham in the meeting
 In truth he misses the limelight a bit
 He misses people listening when he talks
 Put him on Question Time
 They wouldn’t dare
 He’d tell them a thing or two
 Thump the table
 blame the Tories
 raise the roof
 like the good old days
 Or would he
 Maybe not
 He’s drifting now
 Maybe they’d see through him
 maybe his tricks were yesterday’s tricks
 He has certainly lost a yard of pace
 What if they asked about Syria
 Is it Syria
 Libya
 What if Dimbleby looks him in the eye and says
 ‘Mr Ritchie
 tell us what you saw
’ But that was the copper wasn’t it
 And it’s Fiona Bruce now isn’t it
 He likes Fiona Bruce
 Who killed Tony Curran though
 Ventham
 Typical Blairite
 Unless he was missing something
 Was he missing something
Across the path
 Ibrahim is learning the countries of the world
 just to keep his left brain ticking over
 He is letting his right brain get on with the job of thinking about who killed Tony Curran
 Somewhere between Denmark and Djibouti
 he falls asleep
In her three-bed
 in Larkin
 the one with the decking
 Elizabeth cannot sleep
 She is getting used to that these days
Her arm is around her Stephen in the darkness
 Can he feel it
 Does Penny hear her
 Have they both already disappeared
 Or are they only real for as long as she chooses to believe they’re real
 Elizabeth clings on a little tighter and holds on to the day for as long as she is able
Bernard Cottle is online
 His daughter
 Sufi
 had bought him an iPad last Christmas
 He had asked for slippers
 but Sufi hadn’t considered slippers a proper present
 so he’d had to buy himself some in Fairhaven in the sales
 He hadn’t known how to use the iPad
 but Joyce had told him not to be so silly and had taken it out of the drawer and shown him
 By his side
 Bernard has a large glass of whisky and the last slice of Joyce’s coffee and walnut cake
 A pale
 blue glow illuminates his face
 as he looks at the plans for The Woodlands for what must be the hundredth time
One by one
 the lights of the village switch off
 The only remaining illumination comes from behind the thick hospital blinds of Willows
 The business of dying keeping different hours from the business of living
45
Ellidge had seen them first
Every morning
 Edwin Ellidge wakes at 6 a
m
 and walks slowly
 but with purpose
 to the bottom of the drive at Coopers Chase
 Once across the cattle grid and onto the main road
 he looks both ways
 looks again for good measure
 then turns and walks slowly back up the drive
 Job done
 he is back in his flat by 6
30 a
m
 whereupon he is not seen for the rest of the day
Coopers Chase being Coopers Chase
 no one has ever asked him why
 After all
 a woman in Tennyson walks a dog she doesn’t have
 Whatever gets you out of bed
Elizabeth
 being Elizabeth
 once decided to casually intercept him on his walk back
 As she approached him
 the early mist
 her frozen breath and the trudging figure of a man in an overcoat all reminded her of happy times in East Germany
 He raised his gaze to meet hers
 gave a reassuring shake of the head and said
 ‘No need
 I’ve already checked
’ Elizabeth replied ‘Thank you
 Mr Ellidge
’ She turned back and the two of them walked together up the drive in a very pleasant silence
Ibrahim says Ellidge was once a head teacher and latterly a beekeeper
 and Elizabeth had detected a buried hint of Norfolk in his voice
 but that was all the information they had on file for Mr Edwin Ellidge
Ian Ventham’s Range Rover was first
 This was at 6 a
m
 Ellidge saw it veer off the road before it reached him
 taking the track which led up the hill to the Playfair farm
 The diggers passed Ellidge at around 6
20 a
m
 as he was walking home
 He didn’t even give them a glance
 Evidently these were not the vehicles he had been looking for
 They were set
 nose to nose
 on a low-loader that slowly ground its way up the drive
A dawn raid is all well and good for catching drug dealers
 or armed gangs
 but at Coopers Chase it is next to useless
 If such things were logged
 the first phone call would have been recorded at 6
21
 Diggers are here
 coming up the drive
 two of them
 I mean I don’t know
 do you
 That beacon lit
 the news was across the whole village by 6
45 a
m
 at the very latest
 the news spread by landline alone – Ibrahim had tried to set up a WhatsApp group in February
 but it hadn’t caught on
 Residents began to emerge and discuss what could be done
At 7
30 a
m
 Ian Ventham comes back down the hill and turns into the drive to discover the whole village is out
 Except for Edwin Ellidge
 who has had enough excitement for one day
 Karen Playfair is in Ian Ventham’s passenger seat
 She has a breakfast lecture to give at Coopers Chase this morning
The low-loader has continued its slow growl up the drive and is now being carefully driven through the car park
 Bogdan jumps from the passenger seat and unbolts the heavy wooden gate
 so the journey can continue upwards on the narrow path towards the Garden of Eternal Rest
‘Hold up
 son
’ Ron approaches Bogdan and shakes his hand
 ‘Ron
 Ron Ritchie
 What’s all this
’
Bogdan shrugs
 ‘Diggers
’
‘I’ll give you diggers
 son
 What are they doing
’ says Ron
 quickly adding
 ‘Don’t say digging
’
More residents have reached the gate now and they begin to crowd around Ron
 all waiting for an answer
‘Well
 son
 What are they for
’ asks Ron
Bogdan sighs
 ‘You said to not say digging
 I don’t have other answer
’ He looks at his watch
‘Son
 you just opened this gate and this gate only leads one place
’ Ron sees he has a crowd and this is an opportunity he is not going to waste
 He turns towards the gathering
 He spies his gang among them
 Ibrahim has his swimming stuff under one arm
 Joyce has just arrived with a flask and is looking out for someone
 Bernard
 no doubt
 Elizabeth is at the back and there’s a rare sighting of Stephen by her side
 He’s in a dressing gown
 but he’s not the only one
 Ron feels a pang of guilt as he sees Penny’s husband
 John
 in his suit
 as ever
 stopped on his way over to Willows
 Ron hasn’t visited Penny in a long time and knows he must put that right before the chance is gone
 It frightens him
 though
Ron clambers onto the first bar of the gate to address his crowd
 He then almost loses his balance
 thinks the better of it and returns to solid ground
 No matter
 he’s in business here
‘Well
 this is nice
 Just us
 a couple of Polish lads and some diggers
 All enjoying the morning air
 Ventham’s little gang
 Crawling in at six thirty in the morning to dig up our nuns
 No warning
 no consultation
 Coming into our village and digging up our nuns
’ He turns to Bogdan
 ‘That’s your game
 is it
 son
’
‘Yes
 that’s our game
’ concedes Bogdan
Ventham’s Range Rover pulls up alongside the low-loader and he steps out
 He looks at the crowd and then at Bogdan
 who shrugs
 Karen Playfair steps out too and smiles at the scene before her
‘And here’s the man himself
’ says Ron as he spots Ventham walking over
‘Mr Ritchie
’ says Ventham
‘Sorry to disturb your morning
 Mr Ventham
’ says Ron
‘Not at all
 Carry on
 make a speech
’ replies Ventham
 ‘Pretend it’s the fifties
 or whenever you were around
 But when you’re done I’m going to need to access that path to do some digging
’
‘Not today
 old son
 afraid not
’ says Ron
 turning back to the crowd
 ‘We’re all weak
 Mr Ventham
 you can see that
 right
 Look at us
 give us a nudge and we’d topple over
 That’s the last you’d see of us
 We’re feeble
 the lot of us
 we’re a pushover
 A pushover
 eh
 Should be easy
 But
 you know
 there’s a few people here who’ve done a few things in their life
 Am I right
’
Cheers
‘There’s a few people here who’ve seen off
 and no disrespect
 better men than you
’ Ron pauses and looks around at his audience
 ‘We got soldiers here
 one or two
 We got teachers
 we got doctors
 we got people who could take you apart and people who could put you back together again
 We got people who crawled through deserts
 people who built rockets
 people who locked up killers
’
‘And insurance underwriters!’ shouts Colin Clemence from Ruskin
 to happy applause
‘In short
 Mr Ventham
’ says Ron
 his arm sweeping
 ‘we got fighters
 And you
 with your diggers at half seven in the morning
 have picked a fight
’
Ian waits to make certain Ron has finished
 that the bolt has been shot
 then steps forward to talk to the same crowd
‘Thanks
 Ron
 All rubbish
 but thank you
 There’s no fight here
 You’ve had your consultation
 you’ve made your objections
 they were all overturned
 You’ve got lawyers here
 right
 Alongside the people you’re telling me have crawled through deserts
 You’ve got barristers
 Solicitors
 Jesus
 you’ve got judges here! That was your fight
 In court
 It was a fair fight and you lost it
 So if I want to drive onto land that I own at eight a
m
 and carry out work that I’ve planned and that I’m paying for and that
 also no disrespect
 will keep your service charge at the reasonable level it currently is
 then I will
 I will and I am
’
The term ‘service charge’ has a noticeable effect on the softer element in the crowd
 They might well have four hours to kill until lunch and be looking forward to a show
 but this fella does have a point
Joyce and Bernard
 who had slipped away together during Ron’s grandstanding
 are now returning with garden chairs under their arms
 They walk through the crowd and open them out on the path
It is Joyce’s turn to address the crowd
 ‘Radio Kent says it’s going to be lovely all morning
 if some of you would like to join us
 We could make a day of it if anyone’s got a picnic table they’re not using
’
Ron turns to the crowd
 ‘Who’s up for a nice sit down and a cup of tea
’
The crowd gets to business
 chairs and tables to be collected
 kettle on
 see what’s in the cupboard
 too early for a drink
 but let’s see if we can string it out
 If nothing else this should be fun
 Though
 again
 he does make a very good point about the service charge
Ibrahim stands by the cab of the low-loader
 talking to the driver
 He had estimated
 by eye
 that it was thirteen point five metres in length and is gratified to learn that it is thirteen point three
 Not bad
 Ibrahim
 still got it
Elizabeth leads Stephen home
 unscathed
 Make him a coffee and she can head back out
46
The call from Ian Ventham comes through to Fairhaven Police Station at around 7
30 a
m
 Donna is drinking a litre carton of cranberry juice as she overhears the words ‘Coopers Chase’
 She volunteers her services and sends Chris Hudson a text
 He’s off this morning
 but he won’t want to miss this
At 7 a
m
 Father Matthew Mackie receives a call from a Maureen Gadd
 By 7
30 he is up and dressed
 dog collar front and centre and waiting for a cab to the station
47
In front of the gate that leads to the Garden of Eternal Rest there are now twenty chairs
 Mainly sun loungers
 but also one dining chair because of Miriam’s back
As a barricade it is unorthodox
 but effective
 Trees crowd in on either side of the gate
 so the only way up to the Garden of Eternal Rest is now through a phalanx of pensioners
 some of whom are taking the opportunity to stretch out in the morning sun and have a well-earned nap
 The diggers are not getting past for a while
Ian Ventham is back in his car
 watching the scene
 Karen Playfair has stepped outside and is merrily vaping away on an apple and cinnamon e-cigarette
Ian sees picnic tables
 ice-coolers and parasols
 Tea is being fetched and carried on padded trays
 Photographs of grandchildren are being swapped
 The Garden of Eternal Rest is a sideshow
 for most of the residents this is just a street party in the midsummer sun
 No need for Ian to get involved
 they will fold like their loungers the moment the police arrive and they’ll wander off to do whatever they do
Ian is sure this little display will blow over
 but he hopes the police show up soon
 With the amount of tax he hypothetically pays
 it’s really not too much to ask
48
Elizabeth is not at the scene
 Instead
 after dropping Stephen at home
 she has taken a route up through Blunts Wood and
 as she clears the treeline
 she steps onto the broad path leading up to the Garden of Eternal Rest
 She walks up the path until she reaches the wooden bench
 Bernard Cottle’s bench
 where she sits and waits
She looks down towards Coopers Chase
 The path curves towards the bottom
 so the barricade is out of sight
 but she can hear the polite disturbance at the bottom of the hill
 Always look where the action isn’t
 because that’s where the action is
 A part of her is surprised that Joyce hasn’t made the walk up the hill too
 Perhaps she lacks some of Elizabeth’s instincts after all
Elizabeth hears a rustling coming from the trees about twenty metres down on the other side of the path and that rustling very soon turns into the figure of Bogdan emerging from the trees
 with a shovel over his shoulder
He heads up the path
 nodding to Elizabeth as he passes
‘Missus
’ he says
 nodding to her
 If he had a cap
 Elizabeth felt sure he would doff it
‘Bogdan
’ she replies
 ‘I know you have work to do
 but I wonder if I might ask you a question
’
Bogdan stops his walk
 lowers the shovel from his shoulder and rests his weight on the handle
 ‘Please
’ he replies
Elizabeth had been thinking things through last night
 Really – Ventham arrives
 gets inside
 makes his way to the kitchen and then kills Tony Curran within two minutes
 She’d seen it done before
 but not by an amateur
 So what was she missing
‘Did Mr Ventham tell you he wanted Tony Curran murdered
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘After their row
 Perhaps he asked you to help
 Perhaps you did help
’
Bogdan considers her for a moment
 Not fazed
‘I know that’s three questions
 forgive an old woman
’ adds Elizabeth
‘Well
 is only one answer
 so is OK
’ begins Bogdan
 ‘No
 he didn’t tell me and no he didn’t ask
 so no I didn’t help
’
Elizabeth gives this her consideration
 ‘All the same
 it’s worked out nicely for you
 You have a lucrative new job
 don’t you
’
‘Yes
’ agrees Bogdan
 nodding
‘Can I ask if you fitted Tony Curran’s alarm system
’
Bogdan nods
 ‘Sure
 Ian gets me to do all that stuff for people
’
‘So you could have got in
 very easily
 Waited for him
’
‘Sure
 Would have been simple
’
Elizabeth hears more cars pulling up at the bottom of the path
‘I know I’m being rude in asking
 but if Ian Ventham had wanted Tony Curran dead
 might he have asked you to do it
 Is that the sort of relationship you have
’
‘He trust me
’ says Bogdan
 thinking
 ‘So I think maybe he would ask me
 yes
’
‘And what might you have said
 If he had asked you
’
‘There are some jobs I do
 like fix alarms
 tile swimming pools
 and there are some jobs I don’t do
 like kill people
 So
 if he ask
 I say
 “Listen
 maybe you have good reason
 but I would say kill him yourself
 Ian
” You know
’
‘Well
 I agree
’ says Elizabeth
 nodding
 ‘You’re absolutely sure you didn’t kill Tony Curran though
’
Bogdan laughs
 ‘I am absolutely sure
 I would remember
’
‘This has turned into a lot of questions
 Bogdan
 I’m sorry
’ says Elizabeth
‘Is OK
’ says Bogdan
 looking at his watch
 ‘Is still early and I like to talk
’
‘Where are you from
 Bogdan
’
‘Poland
’
‘Yes
 I’d got that
 Which part
’
‘Near Krakow
 You heard of Krakow
’
Elizabeth certainly has heard of Krakow
 ‘I have
 yes
 it’s a very beautiful city
 In fact I went there
 many years ago
’
It was in 1968 to be exact
 to conduct an informal interview
 on trade delegation business
 with a young Polish army colonel
 The Polish army colonel later very happily went on to run a bookmaker’s in Coulsdon and had an MBE for services to the British State
 which stayed in a locked drawer until the day he died
Bogdan looks out over the Kent hills
 He then holds out a hand
 ‘I should work
 It is nice to meet you
’
‘It is nice to meet you too
 My name is Marina
’ says Elizabeth
 as she shakes his huge hand
‘Marina
’ repeats Bogdan
 His smile returns
 once again
 like a baby deer attempting to walk
 ‘Marina was my mother’s name
’
‘How lovely!’ says Elizabeth
 She’s not proud of herself
 but you never know when this sort of thing could come in handy
 And really
 if someone is going to have so much personal information tattooed on his body
 what is she expected to do
 ‘I hope to see you again
 Bogdan
’
‘I hope to see you too
 Marina
’
Elizabeth watches as he continues up the path
 swings open the heavy iron gates and takes his shovel into the Garden of Eternal Rest
There is more than one type of digger
 thinks Elizabeth
 as she starts to walk back down the hill
 She thinks of another question she should have asked
 Does Ian Ventham have the same alarm system as Tony Curran
 If so
 it would have been an easy job for him to get into Tony Curran’s house
 Had he needed to
 She would bet he does
 She will ask Bogdan the next time she sees him
When Elizabeth reaches the barricade
 she finds that the gate has been padlocked and that the padlock is being guarded by three women
 including Maureen Gadd
 who plays bridge with Derek Archer
 Very badly
 in Elizabeth’s view
Elizabeth climbs the gate and makes the small jump on the other side back into the heart of the action
 How many more years of that
 Three or four
 She spies Ian Ventham climbing out of his car as Chris Hudson and Donna De Freitas approach
 Time to join in the fun
 she thinks
 and taps Joyce on the shoulder
 Bernard is asleep in the chair next to her
 which at least explains why Joyce hadn’t come snooping
In theory
 she approves of chasing after men
 if that’s what you wanted to do
 but surely Joyce must find it exhausting
49
Joyce
When Elizabeth arrived
 Bernard had already fallen asleep
 which I think was a blessing
 because he does get worked up
 He had looked tired when I had knocked for him this morning
 I don’t think he’s sleeping at night
Elizabeth and I went to see Donna and Chris
 collecting Ron on the way
 He was looking in the pink
 which was nice to see
 While it is still fresh
 this is everything I remember after that
Donna does something with her eye shadow and I always mean to ask what it is
 but I haven’t yet
 Anyway
 it was DCI Hudson doing the talking and he was quite impressive in his way
 He was saying such and such to Ian Ventham
 Ian Ventham said he wanted us all out of the way and had the paperwork to back it up
 Which seemed fair
DCI Hudson said he wanted to talk to the residents and Ron told him to talk to him (Ron) instead
 Ron also said that Ian Ventham could stick his paperwork up the proverbial
 Which is par for the course for Ron
 as you know
 Donna then suggested that DCI Hudson perhaps should talk to me
 As a level head
 of all things
So DCI Hudson explained the legal niceties to me and warned that he would be forced to arrest anyone who blocked the diggers
 I said that I was sure he wouldn’t actually arrest anyone and he agreed that this was true
 So there we were
 back to square one
Ron then asked DCI Hudson if he was proud of himself and DCI Hudson replied that he was an overweight
 fifty-one-year-old divorcee and so
 by and large
 no
 he wasn’t
 This made Donna smile
 She likes him
 not like that
 but she likes him
 I do too
 I was going to say to him that he wasn’t overweight
 but he actually is a bit and
 as a nurse
 it’s best to never sugar-coat things
 even when your instinct is to be protective
 Instead I told him he should never eat after 6 p
m
 that’s the key if you don’t want diabetes and he thanked me
That’s when Ibrahim joined us and suggested that DCI Hudson might try Pilates and Donna said that was something she would pay to see
 Ian Ventham didn’t want to join in the fun and told Donna and DCI Hudson that he paid their wages
 Donna said in that case could she ask him about a pay rise and that’s when Ian Ventham started shouting the odds about this
 that and the other
 People without a sense of humour will never forgive you for being funny
 But that’s an aside
Anyway
 Ibrahim
 who is very good with this sort of thing
 conflict and inadequate men and stalemates and so on
 stepped in and offered to ‘thin the crowd out’ to give everyone a bit of breathing space
 It was agreed that this was the thing to do
Ibrahim walked over to the barricade picnic
 which was in full swing
 and suggested that anyone who didn’t want to be arrested should perhaps move their chairs off the path
 This shifted a few of the fairweathers
 Colin Clemence led the charge
 When Ibrahim reassured the rest that they only had to clear the path and were very welcome to stay out and watch the action
 there was a proper exodus
 Though not a quick exodus
 because you know that getting out of a garden chair at our age is a military operation
 Once you are in one
 you can be in it for the day
Eventually the scene was as follows
 The barricade
 with the gate firmly locked behind it
 was the stage and the crowd
 happily back in their chairs
 was the audience
 And who was on the stage
 There was Maureen Gadd
 who plays bridge with Derek Archer (and not just bridge
 in my opinion
 but that’s not to be repeated)
 Barbara Kelly from Ruskin who once walked out of Waitrose with a whole salmon and pleaded dementia (my foot
 but it worked) and Bronagh something
 who is new and on whom I have no further information
 I have seen all three of them on their way to the Catholic Mass on Sundays
 then hours later
 trudging back
 They were padlocked to the gate like bikes on railings
And in front of them
 The barricade had disappeared and left just one man
 Awake now
 sitting to attention
 unmoved
 unbowed
 terrific posture
 Bernard
 Unlike him
 I suppose
 but he must feel strongly about the graveyard
 You should have seen him
 The last guard
 like Henry Fonda
 or Martin Luther King
 or King Midas
 This was too much for Ron
 who grabbed a chair and sat right next to him
 Whether out of solidarity or a desire for attention
 who knows
 But I was glad that he did
 I was very proud of them both
 my stubborn boys
(I don’t mean King Midas by the way
 I mean King Canute
)
Ventham had gone back to his car
 for the time being
 with Donna and Chris
I poured Bernard and Ron cups of tea and settled down myself
 assuming the fun was about to end
Which was when the taxi arrived and the fun really began
Forgive me
 my doorbell is ringing
 I’ll be back in a moment
50
Father Matthew Mackie always likes to chat to taxi drivers
 These days they are often Muslim
 even in Kent
 and their kinship makes him feel very comfortable
 They also react well to the dog collar
 But today he has been silent
He is relieved to see that the gate up to the Garden is still locked and guarded and that the diggers are idling on their trailer
 He had left a phone number on the noticeboard outside the chapel for just this eventuality and that was the number Maureen Gadd had phoned this morning
 promising also that she would ‘alert the troops’
Mackie took those ‘troops’ to be the three women in black standing stock-still by the gate
 In front of them are a woman and two men in chairs
 who didn’t seem quite the type
 In fact
 now he looks closer
 he is sure that one is the gentleman with the opinions from the public meeting
 And the man in the middle
 is he the man from the bench the other morning
 Well
 whoever they are
 and whatever their motive
 all are welcome in this particular flock
 To the side of the gate is a crowd of around fifty residents
 sitting
 watching and waiting for a show
 Fine
 he will give them a show
 He supposes this might be his last and only chance
Stepping out of the taxi and giving the driver a large tip
 Father Mackie sees Ventham is in a Ford Focus
 talking to two police officers
 One of them is a large man looking too hot in a jacket
 the other a young
 black woman in uniform
 No sign of Bogdan
 not even in the cab of the trailer
 He will be somewhere nearby
 surely
Mackie wanders over to the gate
 Ventham has yet to spot him
 He takes a moment to speak to
 and bless
 the three guards
 One of them
 the mysterious Maureen Gadd
 asks if there is the chance of a cup of tea and Mackie says he will see what he can do
 Before heading over to confront Ventham
 he stops
 to introduce himself to the seated figures
51
Joyce
Sorry
 the ring at the door was a parcel for upstairs and we always sign for each other
 so that’s where I’ve been
 Sometimes
 if I know Joanna is sending me flowers
 I pretend not to be in
 just so a neighbour picks them up and sees them
 Terrible of me
 really
 but I’m sure people do worse
Anyway
 Bernard was saying that he wouldn’t take orders from the police
 Bernard was staying put and that was that
Ron said that he’d once been chained to a pit shaft in Glasshoughton for forty-eight hours and they’d had to defecate into sandwich bags
 though he didn’t say ‘defecate’
 and that was when Father Mackie introduced himself
I had seen him at the meeting
 He had sat at the back
 quiet as you please and slipped biscuits into his pocket when he thought no one was looking
 As I’ve said
 no one ever realizes I’m watching
 I just have one of those faces
I have to say he was very polite and he thanked us for protecting the Garden
 Bernard told him the Garden was only the start of it and once you give someone an inch
 then we all know what they’d take
 Ron then had to have his say and told Father Mackie that ‘his lot’ (the Catholics) had not always been squeaky clean when it came to graveyards
 but that a liberty is still a liberty and he didn’t like to see one being taken
 Father Mackie said that ‘wouldn’t happen on my watch’ and it all got a bit cowboy film
 which was fine by me
 I like to see men being men
 up to a point
This is when Ventham must have caught sight of Father Mackie
 because over he rushes
 with Chris
 Donna and Ibrahim chasing behind
 And so
 the stage was now set
52
Bogdan has been digging for a long time
 Why not
 Might as well be getting something done
 He started at the very top of the Garden of Eternal Rest
 where the earliest graves are now permanently under the shadow of the wide branches of the trees behind the wall
 The ground is softer
 with no sunlight in many years
 and Bogdan knows that the older
 grander coffins here will be intact
 They will be solid oak
 They won’t be split or rotten
 There will be no skulls staring up at him
 hollow and eaten and hopeful
He hears the odd bit of excitement from down the hill
 but still no rumble of the low-loader
 and so he keeps digging
 One of the machines could uncover a whole row of graves in minutes
 especially if not much care is taken
 which Bogdan knows will be the case
 So he chooses to be neat and tidy
 for as long as it is just him and his shovel
The next grave he chooses to tackle is tucked tightly in the top corner of the graveyard
 As he digs
 he is thinking about Marina
 the woman he met on his way up here
 He has seen her before in the village
 but mainly people don’t talk to him
 they don’t even notice him
 and that’s OK
 He doesn’t suppose you are allowed to visit people here
 but maybe one day if he bumped into her again
 then that would be OK
 He misses his mother some days
Bogdan’s shovel finally strikes something solid
 but it is not the lid of the coffin
 There are many stones and tree roots
 which make the job harder
 but more fun
 for Bogdan
 He reaches down and clears thick earth off the obstruction
 It is pure white
 Beautiful
 in fact
 thinks Bogdan
 in the moment before he realizes what it is
This was not part of Bogdan’s plan
 The very point of digging here was that there would be no rotten coffins and no bones
 And yet here they were
 So even 150 years ago they were cutting corners
 Cheap coffins
 who would ever find out
Should he just fill the grave back in
 Pretend it never happened and wait for the diggers
 Something about that makes him feel uncomfortable
 Bogdan has uncovered a bone and that makes him the guardian
 He has no smaller tool than the shovel with him
 so kneels down on the compacted earth and starts to work with his hands alone
 He is as gentle as he can be
 He shifts his kneeling weight to get a better angle to clear away more dirt
 and as he does so he realizes he is not kneeling on compacted dirt but on something much more solid
 He realizes that he is kneeling on the solid oak lid of the solid oak coffin
 Which can’t be
 A body can’t escape from a coffin
 Bogdan tries to force out a horrific thought
 Had someone been buried alive
 Had they managed to somehow clamber out of the coffin
 but no further
Bogdan works quickly
 with no room for ceremony or superstition
 There are many bones and then a skull
 though he tries not to disturb it
 He uncovers enough of the coffin to jam the blade of his shovel under the lid
 After considerable effort he breaks open the lower third
 Inside is another skeleton
Two skeletons
 One inside the coffin and one outside
 One small
 one big
 One grey and yellow
 one cloud-white
What to do
 Somebody should take a look at it
 that was fairly certain
 Though that would take a long time
 They would dig with tiny trowels
 Bogdan had seen it on TV
 And they wouldn’t just be digging into this grave
 they would be digging into all of them
 And Bogdan knows it will end up being nothing
 It will just be how they used to bury people in this country
 or one year there was a disease and they buried people together
 or a million other possibilities
 Meanwhile the development will be delayed and he will be waiting to work
 So
 the question remains
 What to do
Bogdan needs thinking time
 but unfortunately he doesn’t have that luxury
 In the distance
 Bogdan hears a siren
 He waits a moment and the siren comes closer
 It sounds like an ambulance to Bogdan
 but he knows
 logically
 that it must be the police
 Which means the barricade will be clear soon enough and the circus will begin
 Bogdan hauls himself out of the grave and starts to fill it in once more
Ian will tell me what to do
 he thinks
 as the sirens reach the bottom of the path
53
Ian Ventham
 exiting the police car
 is calm
 happy even
The police have had a placatory chat with him
 He’ll come back tomorrow
 The graves aren’t going anywhere
 Perhaps sending in the diggers so early was a mistake
 But it was a cool thing to do
 so a mistake worth making
 It was a statement
 and making statements is important
 whatever they are
He doesn’t mind the residents being up in arms
 they’ll soon lose interest
 He can just give them something else to complain about
 Sack one of the waiting staff that they like
 or ban grandkids from the pool on health-and-safety grounds
 Then they’ll be all ‘what graveyard
’ He has to laugh
 really
 and so he does
But
 at that very moment
 he sees Father Matthew Mackie
Standing there in his frock and little white collar
 like he owns the place
 As bold as you like
This is Ian’s land
 for Christ’s sake! It’s Ian’s property! He storms towards the barricade
 and has his finger in Father Mackie’s face in seconds
‘If you weren’t a vicar I would knock you out
’ The crowd starts to surround them
 like a fight in a pub car park
 ‘Get off my property
 or I’ll get you thrown off
’
Ian aims a shove at Mackie’s shoulder
 knocking the older man backwards
 Mackie reaches out for balance
 grabbing Ian’s T-shirt
 and the two men lose their balance and fall to the ground together
 Donna
 with the help of a horrified-looking Karen Playfair
 pulls Ian up and off the priest
 A group of residents
 including Joyce
 Ron and Bernard
 then surround and restrain Ian Ventham while a group of residents on the other side form a guard around Father Mackie
 now sitting
 dazed
 on the ground
 School playground really
 but he looks shaken
‘Calm it
 Mr Ventham
 calm down
’ yells Donna
‘Arrest him! Trespass!’ yells Ian
 now being pulled away from the scene by a group of determined septuagenarians
 octogenarians and even one nonagenarian
 who had missed Second World War call-up by a day and has regretted it ever since
Joyce finds herself in the scrum
 How strong these men must have been in their time
 Ron
 Bernard
 John
 Ibrahim
 And how diminished they were now
 The spirit was still willing at least
 but only Chris Hudson was really able to hold Ventham back
 The testosterone was lovely while it lasted though
‘I’m protecting sacred ground
 Peacefully and lawfully
’ says Father Mackie
Donna helps Father Mackie to his feet
 dusting him down and feeling the frailty of the old man beneath the loose black cassock
Chris pulls Ian Ventham from the scrum of bodies surrounding him
 He can see the adrenaline surging through Ventham’s body
 the sort of thing he’s seen a thousand times before
 in the late-night drunks of too many towns
 The veins riding the muscles that poke out from his T-shirt
 a giveaway of steroid abuse
‘Home now
 Mr Ventham
’ orders Chris Hudson
 ‘before I arrest you
’
‘I didn’t touch him
’ protests Ian Ventham
Chris remains quiet
 to keep the conversation private
 ‘He stumbled
 Mr Ventham
 I saw that
 but he stumbled after you made contact with him
 however light
 So if I want to arrest you I will
 And
 allow a policeman a hunch
 there might be one or two witnesses to help me in court
 So
 if you don’t want to be charged with assaulting a priest
 which wouldn’t look good in your brochures
 then you get in your car and you drive away
 Understand
’
Ian Ventham nods
 but without conviction
 his brain already somewhere else
 making some other calculation
 He then shakes his head
 slowly and sadly
 at Chris Hudson
‘Something’s not right here
 Something’s up
’
‘Well
 whatever’s up will still be up tomorrow
’ says Chris
 ‘So get yourself home
 calm yourself down and mop your brow
 Be a man and take a defeat
’
Ian turns and walks towards his car
 Defeat
 As if
 As he passes the low-loader he bangs twice on the cab door and cocks his thumb towards the exit
He walks slowly
 thinking
 Where’s Bogdan
 Bogdan is a good guy
 He’s Polish
 He needs to get Bogdan to tile his swimming pool
 He’s too lazy
 they all are
 He’ll talk to Tony Curran
 Tony will know what to do
 But did Tony lose his phone
 Something about Tony
Ian reaches the Range Rover
 The car has been clamped! His dad will be furious
 he’s only borrowed it
 He’ll have to get the bus from town and his dad will be waiting for him
 Ian is frightened and starts to cry
 Don’t cry
 Ian
 he’ll see
 Ian doesn’t want to go home
He searches his pockets for change
 then stumbles and topples backwards
 He reaches out for something to hold on to
 but
 to his surprise
 there is only air
Ian Ventham is dead before he hits the ground
Part Two

EVERYONE HERE HAS A STORY TO TELL
54
Joyce
I tripped over a loose paving slab in Fairhaven a few weeks ago
 I didn’t mention it in my diary because of murders and trips to London and my pursuit of Bernard
 But it was a nasty tumble and I dropped my bag and my things went everywhere
 Keys
 glasses case
 pills
 phone
Now
 here’s the thing
 Every single person who saw me fall came over to help
 Every single one of them
 A cyclist helped me to my feet
 a traffic warden picked up my things and dusted down my bag
 a lady with a pushchair sat with me at a pavement table until I’d got my breath back
 The woman who ran the café came out with a cup of tea and offered to drive me around to her GP
Perhaps they only came to help because I look old
 I look frail and helpless
 But I don’t think so
 I think I would have helped if I saw a fit youngster take the tumble I did
 I think you would too
 I think I would have sat with him
 I think the traffic warden would have picked up his laptop and I think the woman in the café would still have offered to drive him to her GP
That’s who we are as human beings
 For the most part
 we are kind
However
 I still remember a consultant I once worked with
 at Brighton General
 up on the hill
 A very rude
 very cruel
 very unhappy man
 and he made our lives a misery
 He would shout and would blame us for mistakes he made
Now
 if that consultant had dropped dead in front of my eyes I would have danced a jig
You mustn’t speak ill of the dead
 I know
 but there are exceptions to every rule and Ian Ventham was of the same type as this consultant
 Come to think of it
 he was called Ian too
 so that’s something to look out for
You know those people
 People who feel the world is theirs alone
 They say you see it more and more these days
 this selfishness
 but some people were always awful
 Not many
 that’s what I’m saying
 but always a few
All of which is to say that
 in one way
 I’m sorry that Ian Ventham is dead
 but there is another way to look at it
On any given day lots of people die
 I don’t know the statistics
 but it must be thousands
 So somebody was going to die yesterday and I’m just saying that I would rather it was Ian Ventham who died in front of me than
 say
 the cyclist or the traffic warden
 or the mum with the pushchair
 or the woman who ran the café
I would rather it was Ian Ventham the paramedics failed to save
 than that it was Joanna
 or Elizabeth
 Or Ron
 or Ibrahim
 or Bernard
 Without wanting to sound selfish about it
 I would rather it was Ian Ventham who was zipped into a bag and wheeled into a coroner’s van
 than me
For Ian Ventham
 though
 yesterday was the day
 We will all have one and yesterday was his
 Elizabeth says he was killed
 and if Elizabeth says he was killed then I expect he was
 I don’t suppose he expected that when he woke up yesterday morning
I hope I don’t sound callous
 it’s just that I have seen a lot of people die and I have shed so many tears
 But I have shed none for Ian Ventham and I just wanted you to know why
 It is sad that he is dead
 but it hasn’t made me sad
And now
 if you’ll excuse me
 I have to go and help solve his murder
55
‘Well
 here’s the big headline
’ Chris Hudson is standing at the front of the briefing room
 his team spread out in front of him
 ‘Ian Ventham was murdered
’
Donna De Freitas looks around at the murder squad
 There are a few new faces
 She simply cannot believe her luck
 Two murders and here she is
 right in the middle of it all
 She had to hand it to Elizabeth
 She definitely owed her a drink
 or whatever else Elizabeth might prefer
 A scarf
 Who knew what Elizabeth would like
 A gun
 probably
Chris opens a folder
 ‘Ian Ventham’s death was caused by fentanyl poisoning
 A massive overdose
 delivered into the muscle of his upper arm
 Almost certainly in the moments leading up to his collapse
 You’ll tell by the speed that this is not official
 this is me calling in a favour
 OK
 And they see enough fentanyl overdoses at the path lab these days to know one when they see one
 We’re the only people who have that piece of information at present
 so let’s keep it that way as long as we can
 please
 No press
 no friends and family
’
He gives Donna the briefest of looks
56
‘So
 we were all witnesses to a murder
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Which
 needless to say
 is wonderful
’
Fifteen winding miles away
 the Thursday Murder Club is in extraordinary session
 Elizabeth is laying out a series of full-colour photos of the corpse of Ian Ventham
 alongside every conceivable angle of the scene
 She had taken them on her phone while pretending she was calling for an ambulance
 She then had them privately printed by a chemist in Robertsbridge who owed her a favour
 due to her keeping quiet about a criminal conviction from the 1970s that she had managed to uncover
‘Tragic too
 in its way
 if we wanted to be traditional about our emotions
’ adds Ibrahim
‘Yes
 if we wanted to be melodramatic
 Ibrahim
’ says Elizabeth
‘First question
 then
’ says Ron
 ‘How do you know it was a murder
 Looked like a heart attack to me
’
‘And you’re a doctor
 Ron
’ asks Elizabeth
‘As much as you are
 Liz
’ says Ron
Elizabeth opens a folder and takes out a sheet of paper
 ‘Well
 Ron
 I’ve already been over this with Ibrahim
 because I had a job for him
 but listen carefully
 The cause of death was an overdose of fentanyl
 administered very shortly before death
 This information is straight from a man who has access to the email correspondence of the Kent Police Forensic Service
 but it hasn’t yet been confirmed by Donna
 even though I have texted her repeatedly
 Happy
 Ron
’
Ron nods
 ‘Yeah
 I’ll give you that
 What’s fentanyl
 That’s a new one on me
’
‘It’s an opioid
 Ron
 like heroin
’ says Joyce
 ‘They use it in anaesthesia
 pain relief
 all sorts of things
 Very effective
 patients rave about it
’
‘Also you can mix it with cocaine
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘If you were a drug addict
 say
’
‘And the Russian security services use it for all sorts of things
’ says Elizabeth
Ron nods
 satisfied
Ibrahim says
 ‘And
 as it must’ve been administered very shortly before his death
 then we are all suspects in his murder
’
Joyce claps her hands
 ‘Splendid
 I’m not sure how any of us would have got hold of fentanyl
 but splendid
’ She is arranging Viennese whirls on a plate commemorating Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson’s wedding
 something Joanna had assumed she would like many years ago
Ron is nodding
 looking at the photos of the scene
 Looking at the faces of the residents craning for a better view of Ian Ventham’s slumped body
 ‘So
 someone at Coopers Chase killed him
 Someone in these pictures
’
‘And we are all in the pictures
’ says Ibrahim
‘Except for Elizabeth
 of course
’ says Joyce
 ‘Because she was taking the photos
 But she would still be a suspect for any half-decent investigation
’
‘I would hope so
’ agrees Elizabeth
Ibrahim walks over to a flip chart
 ‘Elizabeth asked me to make a few calculations
’
Elizabeth
 Joyce and Ron settle into the Jigsaw Room chairs
 Ron takes a Viennese whirl
 to the relief of Joyce
 who now feels able to do the same
 They are own-brand
 but there had been a Gregg Wallace programme which had said they were made in the same factory as the proper ones
Ibrahim begins
 ‘Somebody in that crowd administered an injection to Ian Ventham which killed him
 almost certainly within a minute
 There was a puncture wound found on his upper arm
 I asked you all to compile a list of everybody you remembered seeing
 which you kindly did
 although not all of your lists were alphabetized in the way I had asked
’
Ibrahim looks at Ron
 Ron shrugs
 ‘Honestly
 I get mixed up somewhere around F
 H and G and then I give up
’
Ibrahim continues
 ‘If we combine those lists – an easy job if you know your way around an Excel spreadsheet – then in total there were sixty-four residents at the scene
 ourselves included
 Then we add DCI Hudson and PC De Freitas
 the builder Bogdan
 who went missing …’
‘He was up on the hill
’ says Elizabeth
‘Thank you
 Elizabeth
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘We add the driver of the low-loader whose name was Marie
 another Pole if that is of interest
 She also teaches yoga
 but that’s by the by
 Karen Playfair
 the lady who lives at the top of the hill
 was there
 as she was supposed to teach us about computers yesterday
 And then
 of course
 Father Matthew Mackie
’
‘That makes seventy
 Ibrahim
’ says Ron
 now onto his second biscuit
 whatever diabetes might say
‘And Ian Ventham makes seventy-one
’ explains Ibrahim
‘So you think he might have driven up
 started a ruck
 then killed himself
 All right
 Poirot
’ says Ron
‘This isn’t thinking
 Ron
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘This is just a list
 So no impatience please
’
‘Impatience is all I got
’ says Ron
 ‘It’s my superpower
 You know Arthur Scargill once told me to be patient
 Arthur Scargill!’
‘So one of these seventy people killed Ian Ventham
 Now these are nicer odds than the Thursday Murder Club usually faces
 but can we narrow down the field still further
’
‘It would have to be someone with access to needles and drugs
’ suggests Joyce
‘That’s everyone here
 Joyce
’ says Elizabeth
‘Quite so
 Elizabeth
’ agrees Ibrahim
 ‘If I might be permitted a visual image
 that would be like looking for a needle in a haystack made entirely of needles
’
Ibrahim pauses
 under the assumption there might be applause at this point
 In its absence
 he continues
‘Now
 the injection would be the work of a split second to anyone experienced in intramuscular injections
 which
 again
 is all of us
 But the drug would need to be administered at very close quarters
 So
 I have deleted the names of anyone we know
 for a fact
 was never in close proximity to Ian Ventham
 That loses a lot of the supporting cast
 The fact that many of the crowd suffer from severe mobility issues has played into our hands here
 as we know they couldn’t have managed a quick dash when none of us were looking
’
‘No Zimmers
’ agrees Ron
‘We lose eight names on Zimmer frames alone
’ agrees Ibrahim
 ‘Mobility scooters are also our friends here
 as are cataracts
 There are also many people
 such as Stephen
 I hope you agree
 Elizabeth
 who never found themselves close to Ian Ventham on that morning
 They are struck from the list
 Also
 three residents were padlocked to the gate until someone thought to call the fire brigade
 sometime later in the day
 And so here we find ourselves
’
Ibrahim turns over the top sheet of the flip chart to reveal a list of names
‘Thirty names
 Ourselves included
 And one of them is the killer
 I pause only to note that
 alphabetically
 by surname
 I am first on the list
’
‘Well done
 Ibrahim
’ says Joyce
‘So that’s the list
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And I’m guessing it’s now time for the thinking
’
‘Yes
 I think between us we can trim down the list a little further
’ says Ibrahim
‘Who wanted him dead
’ says Ron
 ‘Who gained
 Did the same person kill Curran and Ventham
’
‘Funny to think
 isn’t it
’ says Joyce
 wiping crumbs from the front of her blouse
 ‘That we know a murderer
 I mean
 we don’t know who it is
 but we know we definitely know one
’
‘It’s brilliant
’ agrees Ron
 He is considering biscuit three
 but knows there’s no way he would get away with it
‘Well
 we had better get started
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Conversational French are due in at twelve
’
57
‘Which means
’ says Chris Hudson
 ‘that the fentanyl must have been administered by someone who was there that morning
 So
 one way or another
 we already know our killer
 Today
 we work on a full list of everyone who was there
 which won’t be easy
 but the sooner we have it
 the sooner we’ll have the killer
 And who knows
 maybe Tony Curran’s killer too
 Unless Ventham killed Curran and this was retaliation
’
Donna chances a quick peek out of the briefing-room window
 Her uniformed colleague
 Mark
 is putting on a bicycle helmet
 perfectly complementing his morose expression
 Donna sips her tea – murder squad tea – and thinks about suspects
 She thinks about Father Mackie
 What do they really know about him
 Then she thinks about the Thursday Murder Club
 They were all there
 All surrounding Ventham at one point or another
 She could imagine them each
 in their own particular way
 being a murderer
 Hypothetically
 anyway
 But actually
 She couldn’t see it
 They would certainly have a view
 though
 Donna should probably head over and see them
‘In the meantime
’ continues Chris
 opening another folder
 ‘I have some other fun jobs for you
 Ian Ventham was not a popular man
 His business dealings were complicated and wide-reaching and his phone has revealed a list of affairs
 which must have been pretty tiring for him
 Tell your loved ones they won’t be seeing much of you for a while
’
Loved ones
 Donna thinks about her ex
 Carl
 then realizes she hasn’t thought about Carl for a good forty-eight hours
 which is a new record
 Though she has thought about him now
 which spoils it a little
 She realizes
 though
 that soon she won’t think about him for ninety-six hours
 and then a week
 and before you know it Carl will just seem like a character from a book she once read
 Really
 why had she left London
 What happens when these murders are solved and she’s back in uniform
‘And the rest of you
 no let-up on the Tony Curran case
 The two could be connected
 we can’t rule it out
 We still need the speed-camera info
 I particularly want to know if Ian Ventham’s car was on that road that afternoon
 I need to know where Bobby Tanner is and I need to know who took that photograph
 And I still need the information on the phone number that called Curran
’
Which reminds Donna of a little hunch she has been meaning to check
58
Elizabeth is back in Willows
 sitting in her low chair in Penny’s room
 She is filling Penny in on the drama
‘Simply everyone was there
 Penny
 You would have been in your element
 swinging your truncheon and arresting everyone in sight
 no doubt
’
Elizabeth looks over at John
 in the chair where he spends most of his waking hours
 ‘I’m guessing you filled Penny in on the details
 John
’
John nods
 ‘I may have overstated my own bravery a little
 but other than that
 it was chapter and verse
’
Elizabeth
 satisfied
 pulls a notepad and ballpoint from her handbag
 She taps a page of the notepad with her pen
 like a conductor giving notice to her orchestra
 and begins
‘So
 where are we
 Penny
 Tony Curran is bludgeoned to death
 by person
 or persons
 unknown
 As a side note
 I will never tire of saying “bludgeoned”
 I bet you used to say that a lot in the police
 you lucky thing
 Now Ian Ventham
 meanwhile
 dies within seconds of being injected with a huge dose of fentanyl
 You know fentanyl
 John
’
‘Of course
’ says John
 ‘Used it all the time
 Anaesthetic
 mainly
’
John the vet
 Elizabeth remembers the fox that John nursed back to health with Ron
 Once healthy
 it had gone on to murder Elaine McCausland’s chickens
 Not proven
 but there were no other suspects
 Ron had taken a lot of grief for it at the time
 which had pleased him enormously
‘How easy would it be to get hold of it
’ asks Elizabeth
‘For someone here
’ John starts
 ‘Well
 not easy
 but not impossible
 Pharmacies would have it
 You could break in here
 I suppose
 but you’d have to be very determined
 or very lucky
 And you can get it on the internet
’
‘Goodness
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Can you
’
‘The dark web
 I read about it in The Lancet
 You can get all sorts
 A rocket launcher
 if you really wanted one
’
Elizabeth nods
 ‘And how would one go about getting on the dark web
’
John shrugs
 ‘Well
 I’m guessing
 but if it were me
 the first thing I would do would be to buy a computer
 Perhaps go from there
’
‘Mmm
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Might be worth checking who has a computer
’
‘You never know
’ agrees John
 ‘It would certainly narrow it down
’
Elizabeth turns back to Penny
 How unfair to see her lying there
 ‘One man bludgeoned
 Penny
 the other poisoned
 But by whom
 If Ventham was killed straight away
 then somebody out there this morning killed him
 Me or John
 Or Ron or Ibrahim
 Or … who knows
 Ibrahim has a list of thirty names on a spreadsheet
 to start us off
’
Elizabeth looks at her friend again
 She wants to walk out of the door with her right now
 arm in arm
 Share a bottle of white
 listen to her swear like a docker about some imagined slight and sway home happy and tipsy
 But that will never happen again
‘I always find it peculiar that Ibrahim doesn’t come and visit you
 Penny
’
‘Oh
 he does
’ says John
‘Ibrahim visits
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘He’s never said
’
‘Like clockwork
 Elizabeth
 Every day he brings a magazine and solves bridge puzzles with her
 He talks them through
 They solve a puzzle
 he kisses her hand and off he pops half an hour later
’
‘And Ron
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘Does he visit
’
‘Never
’ says John
 ‘I suppose it’s not for everyone
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth nods
 She supposes so too
 Back to business
 ‘So
 Penny
 who wants to kill Ian Ventham
 And why at the very moment digging was about to start
 I suspect your question might be
 who loses what if the development goes ahead
 Wouldn’t you think
 I want to talk to you about Bernard Cottle at some point
 Do you remember him
 With the Daily Express and the nice wife
 I feel like there is a motive there
 waiting to be winkled out
’
Elizabeth stands
 ready to leave
‘Who loses what
 Penny
 That’s the question
 isn’t it
’
59
Chris Hudson has his own office
 a little bolthole where he can pretend to work
 There is a space on his desk where a family photograph might ordinarily sit and he feels a prick of shame every time he notes its absence
 Perhaps he should have a photo of his niece
 How old was she now
 Twelve
 Or maybe fourteen
 His brother would know
So who killed Ventham
 Chris was right there when it happened
 One way or another
 he actually watched him being killed
 Who had he seen
 The Thursday Murder Club
 they were all there
 the priest
 The attractive woman in the jumper and trainers
 Now who was she
 Was she single
 Now’s not the time
 Chris
 Concentrate
Had the same person murdered Ventham and Tony Curran
 It made sense
 Solve one
 solve the other
Who were the three calls to Tony Curran’s phone from
 Almost certainly someone trying to sell him life insurance
 but you never knew
 Chris is sure that Tony Curran’s phone could tell all sorts of tales
 Human rights are all well and good
 but Chris would love to tap the phone of every single person in Fairhaven who looked even a bit suspicious
 Like they do in prison
He remembers an armed robber called Bernie Scullion who ran out of money in Parkhurst
 but wanted to buy himself a PlayStation
 so phoned his uncle and told him where he’d buried half a million pounds
 The police had the money and the uncle within the hour and Bernie never got his PlayStation
There is a knock at the door and Chris has the brief
 disturbing
 realization that he hopes it’s Donna
‘Come
’
The door opens
 It’s DI Terry Hallet
 Terrifyingly efficient
 handsome in that Royal Marine way that everyone seemed to like
 but also
 annoyingly
 a nice guy
 Chris would never be able to wear a T-shirt that tight
 One day Terry will have this office
 Terry has four kids and a happy marriage
 Imagine the photographs he will have on the desk
 Chris wishes he was Terry
 but who really knew what went on at home
 Perhaps Terry had a hidden sadness
 perhaps he cried himself to sleep
 Chris doubts it
 but at least it’s something to cling to
‘I can come back
’ says Terry and Chris realizes he has been staring at him for a beat too long
‘No
 no
 sorry
 Terry
 miles away
’
‘Thinking about Ian Ventham
’
‘Yep
’ lies Chris
 ‘What have you got
’
‘Sorry to drag you back to Tony Curran
 but I’ve got something I think you’re going to like
’ says Terry
 ‘I’ve got a car that took twelve minutes to travel the half mile between the two speed cameras either side of Tony Curran’s house
 Exactly the right time frame too
’
Chris looks at the details
 ‘So it stopped somewhere between the two
 Nice little ten-minute break for something or other
’
Terry Hallet nods
‘Anything else around there except Tony Curran’s house
 Somewhere you’d stop
’
‘There’s a lay-by
 If you needed a slash
 But …’
‘Long slash
’ agrees Chris
 ‘We’ve all had them
 but even so
 And you’ve run the number plate
’
Terry nods again
 Then smiles
‘I like that smile
 Terry
 What have you got
’
‘You won’t believe the registered owner
 Guv
’
Terry slides another piece of paper onto Chris’s desk
 Chris takes it in
‘Well
 this is very good news
 Are you sure about these timings
’
Terry Hallet nods and drums his fingers on Chris’s desk
 ‘That’s our killer
 surely
’
Chris has to agree
 Time to go and have a chat
60
Bogdan has seen where Marina lives
 and now is as good a time as any
 She will know what to do about the bones
 he sensed that as soon as he met her
 He has brought her flowers
 Not from the shop but from the wood
 tied the way his mother used to tie them
Flat 8
 He presses the buzzer and a man’s voice answers
 This surprises Bogdan
 He has kept a close eye on her for a while and not seen a man
The external door to the flats swings open
 ‘I am here for Marina
 To see Marina
’ he says as he walks through
 The first door off the carpeted hallway swings open and he sees an elderly man in pyjamas running a comb through his thick
 grey hair
 Maybe he has got this wrong
 Either way
 the man will know Marina and can point him in the right direction
‘I come looking for Marina
’ says Bogdan
 ‘I think maybe she live here
 but maybe another flat
’
‘Marina
 Of course
 of course
 come in
 let’s get the kettle on shall we
 Never too early
 is it
’ says Stephen
With an arm around his shoulder
 the man ushers Bogdan in
 Bogdan is relieved to see a picture of Marina
 a younger Marina
 on the hallway table
 It’s the right flat
‘I don’t know where she is
 old chap
 but she won’t be long
’ says Stephen
 ‘Probably at the shops or round at her mother’s
 Sit yourself down and let’s make the most of the peace and quiet
 eh
 You play chess at all
’
61
Chris Hudson is pulling his coat over his jacket as he leaves the station
 He turns as a voice behind him calls out
 ‘Sir
’
It is Donna De Freitas
 She catches up with him
‘Wherever you’re going
 I think I’ve got a change of plan for you
’ says Donna
‘I doubt it
 PC De Freitas
’ says Chris
 He still calls her PC De Freitas at work
 ‘I’m off to have a little chat with someone
’
‘Only
 I was looking through the call logs
’ says Donna
 ‘And I recognized the number
’
‘The mobile that called Tony Curran
’
Donna nods
 then takes out a scrap of paper for Chris to see
 ‘Remember this
 Jason Ritchie’s number
 He’s the one who phoned Tony three times on the morning of the murder
 Is this worth a change of plan
’
Chris holds up a finger to silence her and takes the piece of paper Terry Hallet had handed him from his jacket pocket
 He passes it to Donna
 ‘Vehicle records
 from the day of the murder
’
Donna reads and then looks up at Chris
‘Jason Ritchie’s car
’
Chris nods
‘Jason rings Tony Curran that morning
 Jason’s car is outside Tony’s house when he dies
 So we’re going to see Jason
’
‘Maybe just me this time
’ says Chris
‘I don’t think so
’ says Donna
 ‘Firstly
 I’m your shadow
 which is a sacred bond of trust et cetera
 et cetera
 And secondly
 I just solved the crime
’
She waves Jason’s phone number at him
Chris waves the vehicle records at her
 ‘I solved it first
 Donna
 So I’m just going to pay him a quick visit at home
 alone
 and see if he wouldn’t mind answering a couple of questions
 Very low key
’
Donna nods
 ‘Good idea
 He’s not at home
 though
 I checked already
’
‘Then where is he
’
‘If you take me along
 I’ll show you
’ says Donna
‘And what if I ordered you to tell me where he was
’ asks Chris
‘Well
 you can try
’ says Donna
 ‘See where it gets you
’
Chris shakes his head
 ‘Come on
 then
 you can drive
’
62
Neither Chris nor Donna had known that Maidstone had an ice rink
 Why on earth did Maidstone have an ice rink
 That had been a large part of the conversation on the drive there
 This was after Donna had asked Chris to turn off his compilation of early Oasis B-sides
Bit by bit
 Donna was intent on dragging Chris from his century into hers
The mystery had not been solved when they pulled up outside Ice-Spectacular
 How was anyone making money out of an ice rink
 just off a ring road
 sandwiched between a tile warehouse and a Carpetright
Chris would often tell friends that if there was a business in their neighbourhood that didn’t make any sense
 which had no customers
 then it was a front for a drugs business
 Always
 No real customers needed
 no real profit needed
 just a way of washing money
 Every town had one
 tucked away somewhere on a little row of shops
 or in the railway arches
 or sat next to a Carpetright
 Whether it was a waxing parlour
 or a party lights hire shop or an ice rink with a neon sign that last lit up in 2011
Always a front
 always drugs
 thought Chris as he closed the passenger door of his Focus
 Which seemed apt
 given who Chris and Donna were here to see
They walk through the front doors
 across the sticky
 carpeted foyer and into the arena
 At this time of day it is mostly empty
 except for an elderly man hoovering up popcorn from rows of plastic seats and two figures out on the ice
Anyone who had seen Jason Ritchie in his prime would tell you the same
 He had a fluid strength
 his feet simply gliding around the ring
 Those powerful arms arcing through the air
 or flicking forwards in rib-rattling jabs
 His tiny feints and dips
 eyes never leaving his opponent
 his whole body ready to pounce and strike
 He wasn’t a slugger
 a big plank of wood
 a zombie
 He was an athlete
 strong and brave
 a magnificent
 flowing machine
 everything given
 nothing wasted
 With his grace and his poise and his movement
 Jason Ritchie was beautiful to watch
However
 as Chris and Donna sip on coffees
 watching
 it becomes apparent that Jason Ritchie cannot ice dance
The session seems to be over
 as Jason is gingerly skating towards the side of the rink
 his elbow being supported by a small woman in a purple leotard
 Even so
 about a metre from the sweet safety of the side
 Jason’s left skate disappears from underneath him
 slices into his right skate and his tumbling weight is too much for the lady in the leotard to save
 The big man is down again
 Chris and Donna have been watching for only a matter of minutes
 but have already lost count of his falls
Chris leans over the board and offers a hand
 It is the first time Jason clocks the two officers
 He has been preoccupied
 He looks Chris in the eye as he takes the proffered hand and finally reaches dry land
‘Have you got five minutes
 Jason
’ asks Chris
 ‘We’ve come ever such a long way
’
‘Are you OK
 Jason
’ asks the lady in the leotard
Jason nods and gestures for her to go on ahead
 ‘Yeah
 couple of mates
 I’m going to stop for a chat
’
‘Well
 look
 I’m going to write this all up and send it to the producers
’ says the skater
 ‘You’re not a lost cause
 I promise!’
‘Darling
 you’re a superstar
 thanks for putting up with me and picking me up off my arse
’
‘Hopefully see you on the show!’ says the skater and waves as she disappears up the steep stairs on her narrow blades
Jason collapses onto a moulded plastic chair
 which bends a little under his weight
 He starts to unlace his skates
‘Thought I might see the two of you again
 You got another photo for me
’
‘Well
 shall we dive straight in
’ starts Chris
 ‘What were you doing at Tony Curran’s house on the day he was murdered
’
‘None of your business
’ says Jason
 He nearly has the first skate off
 though it’s a struggle
‘But you agree you were there
’ asks Donna
‘Am I under arrest
’ asks Jason
‘Not yet
’ says Donna
‘Then it’s none of your business if I was or I wasn’t
’ The first skate is finally off
 Jason puffs like he’s gone three rounds
‘Just so you have the full picture
’ says Chris
 pulling out his phone from his pocket and swiping it into life
 ‘We’d been trying to find Ian Ventham’s car on the traffic cameras near Tony Curran’s house
 A nice open-and-shut case
 Ian Ventham didn’t visit Tony Curran that afternoon
 but we found something even more interesting
 The first traffic camera catches your car
 Jason
 about four hundred yards east of Tony’s house at three twenty-six and then the next camera
 the other side of Tony’s house
 catches you at three thirty-eight
 So either you took twelve minutes to drive half a mile
 or you stopped somewhere in between
’
Jason looks at Chris very calmly
 then shrugs and starts on his right skate
‘OK
 I’ve got one too
’ says Donna
 ‘The day that Tony Curran was murdered
 did you ring him
’
‘Don’t remember
 I’m afraid
’ Jason is picking at what seems to be an impossible knot in his laces
‘You’d remember that though
 Jason
 wouldn’t you
’ asks Donna
 ‘Ringing Tony Curran
 One of the old gang
 wasn’t he
’
‘Never been in a gang
’ says Jason
 finally making a breakthrough with the knot
Chris nods
 ‘But here’s our issue
 Jason
 A mystery number phones Tony Curran three times on the morning of his death
 A number we couldn’t trace
 thanks to Vodafone and to data protection legislation
 But a number that
 thankfully
 you had personally written down and handed to PC De Freitas
 So your number
 Jason
’
Jason finally has the second skate off
 He nods
 ‘That was silly of me
’
‘And then
 that very afternoon
 you are driving along the road outside Tony Curran’s house
 at which point you stop to perform some sort of errand
 which takes around ten minutes
 At the exact time that Tony Curran was murdered
’ Chris looks at Jason for a response
‘Yep
 Sounds like you’ve got yourself a mystery there
’ says Jason
 ‘Now I’ve got these skates off
 I’m going to head back
’
Jason stands
 Chris and Donna do too
‘I wonder if you’d like to come in and give us some fingerprints and a bit of DNA
’ says Chris
 ‘Just to eliminate you from our inquiries
 We could eliminate you from two murders at once
 That would be nice
’
‘You should probably ask yourself why you don’t have my prints and DNA already
’ says Jason
 ‘Maybe because I’ve never been arrested for anything
’
‘Never been caught
 Jason
’ says Chris
 ‘That’s different
’
‘Be interesting to hear a motive too
’ says Jason
‘Robbery
’ says Chris
 ‘Man like that has a lot of money lying around
 You got any money worries at the moment
’
‘I think time’s up here
 don’t you
’ says Jason
 starting to climb the stairs to the changing room
 Chris and Donna don’t follow
‘Or are you doing Celebrity Ice Dance for the prestige
 Jason
’ asks Donna
 To which Jason turns and gives a genuine smile
 Then raises his middle finger
 turns again and continues towards the dressing room
Chris and Donna see him disappear
 then sit back down on their plastic chairs and look out over the empty ice
‘What do you make of that
’ asks Chris
‘If he did it
 why on earth would he leave a photo with him in it by the body
’ asks Donna
Chris shakes his head
 ‘Perhaps some people are just stupid
’
‘He doesn’t seem stupid
’ says Donna
‘Agreed
’ agrees Chris
63
From outside
 Elizabeth can immediately see that something is wrong
 The curtains in Stephen’s study are open
 They are always closed
 Stephen doesn’t like the glare of the morning sun when he writes
Her brain makes all of the necessary calculations in a second
 Has Stephen woken and broken his routine
 Is he hurt
 Lying on the floor
 Alive
 Dead
Or has someone broken in
 Someone from her past life
 It does happen
 even now
 She has heard of it happening
 Or perhaps someone from the messy present has paid her a visit
Elizabeth circles to the fire door at the back of Larkin Court
 It is impossible to open from the outside without a piece of kit available only to the Fire Service
 Elizabeth opens it and slides inside
Her feet make no sound on the carpeted hallway
 but they would have made no sound on the concrete walkway of an East German detention centre
 She takes out her keys and coats the Yale in lip balm
 It makes no noise when she inserts it in the lock and Elizabeth opens the door as quietly as she can
 Which is very quietly
If there is someone in the flat Elizabeth knows her time may be up
 Holding her key ring in the palm of her hand
 she slides a different key through each of the gaps in her fist
Stephen has not collapsed in the hallway
 that is news at least
 His study door is open
 morning sun streaming in
 She feels a momentary shame at the bright dust dancing in the doorway
‘Checkmate
’ says a voice from the living room
 An eastern European voice
‘Well I’m damned
’ replies Stephen
Elizabeth slips her keys back into her bag and opens the living-room door
 Stephen and Bogdan sit across the chess board from each other
 They both smile to see her
‘Elizabeth
 look who it is!’ says Stephen
 gesturing to Bogdan
Bogdan has a moment of confusion
 ‘Elizabeth
’
‘He calls me that
 He gets things wrong
’ To Stephen
 ‘It’s Marina
 dear
 remember
’ This doesn’t feel wonderful
 but needs must
‘Like the man said
’ agrees Stephen
Bogdan has risen from his chair and extends his hand towards Elizabeth
 ‘I brought you flowers
 Your husband has put them somewhere
 I’m not sure where
’
Stephen is examining the end-game on the chess board
 ‘The bugger got me
 Elizabeth
 Fair and square
’
Elizabeth looks at her husband
 crouched over the board
 backtracking moves
 clearly delighted with the trap in which he has been caught
 Life in the old dog yet
 then
 thinks Elizabeth
 and falls in love again for the thousandth time
 She repeats
 ‘It’s Marina
 darling
’
‘I call you Elizabeth
 Is OK
’ says Bogdan
‘He fixed the light in my study too
 dear
’ says Stephen
 ‘We have a marvel on our hands
’
‘That’s very kind of you
 Bogdan
 I’m sorry we’re not as clean as we might be
 We don’t get guests
 so sometimes …’
Bogdan places his hand on Elizabeth’s upper arm
 ‘You have a beautiful home
 Elizabeth
 and a wonderful husband
 I wonder if I can speak to you
’
‘Of course
 Bogdan
’ says Elizabeth
‘I can trust you
’ asks Bogdan
 staring deep into Elizabeth’s eyes
‘You can trust me
’ says Elizabeth
 her eyes never leaving his
Bogdan nods
 He believes her
‘Can we go for a walk
 You and I
 This evening
’
‘This evening
’ asks Elizabeth
‘I have something to show you
 Is best to wait till dark
’
Elizabeth studies Bogdan
 ‘Something to show me
 Any clues
’
‘Yes
 It is something you will be interested to see
’ says Bogdan
‘Well
 I’ll be the judge of that
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And where will we be walking
 Bogdan
’
‘To the cemetery
’ says Bogdan
‘The cemetery
’ A slight shiver runs down Elizabeth’s spine
 How wonderful the world can be at times!
‘I meet you here
’ says Bogdan
 ‘And wear warm clothes
 we be there for a while
’
‘I think you can count me in
’ says Elizabeth
64
Joyce
Yes
 I know Ian Ventham is dead
 and we will get to that
 I promise
 But guess what else
 Joanna is here!
We took ourselves down to Fairhaven in her new car (I will check the make in a moment)
 We stopped at Anything with a Pulse
 I was very casual about it
 but it was an unqualified success
 Not a word of complaint
 or
 ‘No one’s a vegan any more
 Mum
’ or
 ‘They do better brownies in a Lebanese shop round the corner from mine
 Mum
’ Green tea
 flapjack
 macaroon
 And I didn’t think I’d be saying that
She has a meeting down this way
 Something to do with ‘optimization’
 If I think back to that girl who would eat her fish fingers and potato waffles
 but scream blue murder about eating her peas
 I didn’t imagine she would ever be having meetings about ‘optimization’
 Whatever it is
The boyfriend is history
 as we’d guessed
 Did you know you can lock your mobile phones these days
 so that no one can take a peek
 And you can unlock them with your thumbprint
 Anyway
 he had fallen asleep on the sofa one evening and she had used his thumb to open his phone
 One look through his messages and
 by the time he woke up
 his suitcases were packed and in the hall
 That’s my girl
No details of the messages were forthcoming
 but Joanna strongly hinted that photographs were involved
 I listen to enough Woman’s Hour to get the gist of that
 Excuse my language
 but the silly sod
We had a giggle about it
 so I don’t think her heart is broken
I can hear Joanna getting up from a nap
 so I’ll say bye for now
 You wouldn’t know it
 but I’ve been typing quietly
My gorgeous baby
 happy and sleeping in my bed
 and two murders to solve
 Who could ask for more
Joanna brought a bottle of wine down with her
 There is something special about it
 but I’m afraid I’ve forgotten what it is
 One day she will realize that she is the something special
 Anyway
 I invited Elizabeth over to have a drink with us this evening
 but she has ‘other plans’
Your guess is as good as mine there
 Something to do with the murder though
 you can bet on that
(ADDITIONAL NOTE ADDED LATER
 IT IS AN AUDI A4)
65
The path up the hill towards the Garden of Eternal Rest is a pale ribbon in the dusk light
 Bogdan offers his arm and Elizabeth takes it
‘Stephen is not well
’ says Bogdan
‘No
 dear
 he’s not well
’
‘You put something in his coffee I think
 When we left
’
‘We’re all on pills for something
 dear
’
Bogdan nods
 he understands
They walk past the bench where Bernard Cottle spends most of his days
 Elizabeth has been thinking some more about Bernard
 has had to in the circumstances
 She always gets the sensation that he is keeping guard for the cemetery
 That he’s somehow at sentry duty on his bench
 He won’t go in
 but he’s never far away
 What does Bernard lose if the development goes ahead
 She would have to speak to him at some point
 or
 perhaps better
 ask Ron and Ibrahim to speak to him
 Which might mean tiptoeing around Joyce
‘He hasn’t played chess in a long time
 Bogdan
 That was nice to see
’
‘He is good
 He was a tough player for me
’
They have reached the iron gates of the Garden of Eternal Rest
 Bogdan pushes one of them open and guides Elizabeth through into the cemetery
‘You must be quite the player yourself
’
‘Chess is easy
’ says Bogdan
 continuing the walk between the lines of graves and now flicking on a torch
 ‘Just always make the best move
’
‘Well
 I suppose
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘I’ve never quite thought about it like that
 But what if you don’t know what the best move is
’
‘Then you lose
’ Bogdan leads her on for a few more paces before stopping by an old grave in the top corner
‘You said I can trust you
 OK
’ says Bogdan
‘Implicitly
’ says Elizabeth
‘Even though you are really called Elizabeth
 because I see bills in the study
’
‘Sorry
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘But
 other than that
 implicitly
’
‘Is OK
 whatever you need to do
 But if I show you something
 you don’t tell the police
 you don’t tell no one
’
‘You have my word
’
Bogdan nods
 ‘You sit while I dig
’
It is a pleasant evening to sit on the steps of a statue of Jesus Christ
 and Elizabeth watches very happily as Bogdan
 over to her left
 starts digging the grave in the faint torchlight
 She wonders what he might have uncovered
 What secret was he about to reveal
 She goes through the possibilities in her head
 The most obvious answer was money
 There would be a suitcase
 or a canvas sports bag
 and Bogdan would heave it out and lay it at her feet
 Banknotes
 gold perhaps
 a haul
 buried by goodness knows who and goodness knows when
 And a big haul too
 or why has Bogdan dragged her up here in the middle of the night
 Enough for someone to kill for
 A couple of thousand and surely Bogdan would just have taken it
 Finders keepers
 no harm done
 But
 a suitcase full of fifties
 well that would –
‘OK
 you come see
’ says Bogdan
 standing in the grave
 spade now over his shoulder
Elizabeth pushes herself up
 walks over to the grave and sees what Bogdan saw the morning that Ian Ventham was murdered
 She supposes that of all the things to find in a grave
 a body should be the least surprising
 But as Bogdan’s torch plays over the bones and the coffin lid on which they rest
 she has to admit this wasn’t what she had been expecting
‘You thought money
 right
’ says Bogdan
 ‘Maybe I found some money or something and didn’t know what to do
’
Elizabeth nods
 Money or something
 Bogdan is very good
‘I know
 Sorry
 no money
 Would have been good
 Instead
 bones
 Bones inside the coffin
 Other bones
 different bones
 outside the coffin
’
‘And you found these yesterday
 Bogdan
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Just when Ian was killed
 yes
 I didn’t know what to do
 I wanted a day to think
 Maybe it’s nothing
 do you think
’
‘I’m afraid it’s probably something
 Bogdan
’ says Elizabeth
‘Yes
 maybe is something
’ agrees Bogdan glumly
Elizabeth sits now and dangles her feet into the grave
 She looks down on the lid of the coffin
 ‘So you opened the coffin
’
‘I thought was best
 To check
’
‘Quite right
’ agrees Elizabeth
 ‘And you’re sure it’s a different body in there
’
Bogdan jumps into the grave and pulls away part of the coffin lid
 exposing the bones inside
 ‘Yes
 Bones where bones should be
 Much older
’
Elizabeth nods and thinks
 ‘So
 two bodies
 One where it belongs and another
 much newer
 where it doesn’t belong
’
‘Yes
 Maybe I should have told police
 but I don’t know
 You know how the police are
’
‘I do know
 Bogdan
 You did the right thing coming to me
 At some point we might need to talk to the police
 but not yet
 I think
’
‘So what do we do
’
‘Fill it back in
 Bogdan
 if you wouldn’t mind
 Just for the time being
 Give me some thinking time
’
‘I dig
 I fill in
 I dig
 I fill in
 Whatever you need
 until the job is done
 Elizabeth
’
‘We are birds of a feather
 Bogdan
’ says Elizabeth
 thinking she must call Austin
 He’ll know what to do with all this
She looks down towards the lights of the village
 Mostly off now
 but Ibrahim’s light is shining bright
 He’ll be working away
 Good man
She looks back at Bogdan
 shovelling earth into the grave
 covered in dirt and sweat
 Sliding a broken coffin lid back over one body while carefully avoiding disturbing another body
 She thinks this is absolutely the sort of son she would like to have had
66
‘They are bang at it all the time
’ says Ron
 ‘Always have been
 Whatever it is
 the Catholic Church will have a piece of it
’
‘Even so
’ says Ibrahim
Ibrahim and Ron are discussing who might have murdered Ian Ventham
They are working their way through the list of thirty names
 weighing up the possibilities
 It is just the boys this evening
 Joyce has Joanna staying and Elizabeth was nowhere to be found
 Which
 at this time of the evening
 was suspicious
 but they have chosen to carry on regardless
Ron is insisting on marking everyone out of ten
 and the more whisky he drinks
 the higher his scores are climbing
 Maureen from Larkin had just scored a seven
 largely because she had once pushed in front of Ron at dinner
 which ‘spoke a thousand words’
‘Father Mackie’s our first ten
 Ibbsy
 write it down
 Top of the list
 He’ll have something buried up in one of the graves
 Guaranteed
 nailed on
 Gold
 or a body
 or porn
 All three
 knowing that lot
 He’s worried they’ll dig it up
’
‘Seems unlikely
 Ron
’ says Ibrahim
‘Well
 you know what Sherlock Holmes said
 old son
 If you don’t know who did it
 then … something or other
’
‘Indeed
 wise words
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘And Father Mackie wouldn’t just have dug it up himself
 Ron
 At some point
 To save himself the worry
’
‘Lost his spade
 I dunno
 Mark my words though
’ says Ron
 those very words beginning to slur gently and warmly
 Late nights
 whisky
 something to solve
 this was the life
 ‘It’s a ten from me
’
‘This is not Strictly Come Poisoning
 Ron
’ Ibrahim strongly disagrees with Ron’s marking system
 but writes ‘10’ next to Father Mackie’s name
 As it happens
 Ibrahim also strongly disagrees with the Strictly Come Dancing scoring system
 believing it gives too much weight to the public vote when compared to the judges’ scores
 He once wrote a letter to this effect to the BBC and received a friendly
 but non-committal
 reply
 He looks at the next name on the list
‘Bernard Cottle
 Ron
 What do we think there
’
‘Another of the big guns for me
’ The ice in Ron’s whisky chimes as he gestures with his glass
 ‘See how he was that morning
’
‘He has become increasingly agitated
 I agree
’
‘And we know he sits up there a lot
 on that bench
 like he’s marking his territory
’ says Ron
 ‘Used to sit there with his wife
 didn’t he
 So that’s where he gets his peace
 innit
 You can’t take that away from a man
 especially our age
 Too much change don’t sit right
’
Ibrahim nods
 ‘Too much change
 yes
 There comes a time when progress is only for other people
’
For Ibrahim one of the beauties of Coopers Chase was that it was so alive
 So full of ridiculous committees and ridiculous politics
 so full of arguments
 of fun and of gossip
 All the new arrivals
 each one subtly shifting the dynamic
 All the farewells too
 reminding you that this was a place that could never stay the same
 It was a community and
 in Ibrahim’s opinion
 that was how human beings were designed to live
 At Coopers Chase
 any time you wanted to be alone
 you would simply close your front door and any time you wanted to be with people
 you would open it up again
 If there was a better recipe for happiness than that
 then Ibrahim was yet to hear it
 But Bernard had lost his wife
 and showed no signs of finding a way through his grief
 And so he needed to sit on Fairhaven Pier
 or on a bench on a hill
 and nobody ever needed to ask why
‘Where is your place
 Ron
’ asks Ibrahim
 ‘Where do you find your peace
’
Ron purses his lips and chuckles
 ‘If you’d asked me a question like that a couple of years ago I’d have laughed and left
 wouldn’t I
’
‘You would
’ agrees Ibrahim
 ‘I have successfully changed you
’
‘I think
’ starts Ron
 face alert
 eyes alive
 ‘I think …’ Ibrahim sees Ron’s face relax as he decides to just let the truth come out
 rather than think
 ‘Honestly
 I’m flicking through it all in my head
 all the things you’re supposed to say
 But
 listen
 It might be here in this chair
 with my mate
 drinking his whisky
 dark outside
 with something to talk about
’
Ibrahim knots his hands together and lets Ron talk
‘Just think of everyone who isn’t here
 Ibbsy
 Every bugger who didn’t make it
 And here we are
 a boy from Egypt and a boy from Kent
 and we made it through it all
 and then someone in Scotland made us this whisky
 That’s something
 isn’t it
 This is the place
 isn’t it
 old son
 This is the place
’
Ibrahim nods and agrees
 His place of peace is actually the wall of files directly behind him
 but he doesn’t want to spoil the moment
 Ron has stopped speaking
 and Ibrahim can see he has gone somewhere very deep inside himself
 Lost to memories
 Ibrahim knows to keep quiet
 to let Ron go where he needs to go
 To think what he needs to think
 Something Ibrahim has seen so many times over the years
 with people in that very armchair
 It is his favourite thing about his job
 Seeing someone go deep inside themselves to access things they never knew were there
 Ron tilts his head up
 he is ready to talk again
 Ibrahim leans forward
 just a touch
 Where has Ron just been
‘Do you think Bernard is banging Joyce
 Ibbsy
’ says Ron
Ibrahim leans back
 just a touch
 ‘I haven’t really thought about it
 Ron
’
‘Course you have
 I know you have
 Psychiatrist
 I bet he is
 lucky sod
 All that cake and what have you
 Could you still
 you know
 if you had to
’ he asks
‘No
 not for a few years now
’
‘Same
 same
 A blessing in some ways
 I was a slave to it
 Anyway
 I’d say he’s a nine
 wouldn’t you
 Old Bernard
 He was there
 you could see he doesn’t want the place bulldozed
 and he worked in science or something didn’t he
’
‘Petrochemicals I think
’
‘There you are then
 fentanyl
 Nine
’
Ibrahim is inclined to agree
 Bernard does not seem to be living entirely in grace
 He writes a ‘9’ next to Bernard Cottle’s name
‘Of course
 if they are banging
 Joyce won’t like that nine
’ says Ron
‘Joyce has the same information that we have
 She will already know he’s a nine
’
‘She’s no fool
 that one
’ agrees Ron
 ‘What about that girl from the top of the hill
 The farmer’s girl with the computers
’
‘Karen Playfair
’ says Ibrahim
‘She was there
 eh
’ says Ron
 ‘Bang in the middle of it
 Probably knows a thing or two about drugs
 Pretty
 too
 and that’s always trouble
’
‘Is it
’
‘Always
’ says Ron
 ‘To me
 anyway
’
‘Motive
’ asks Ibrahim
Ron shrugs
 ‘Affair
 Forget graveyards
 it’s usually an affair
’
‘A seven perhaps
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Or perhaps a seven with an asterisk and a footnote explaining that the asterisk means “in need of further investigation”
’
‘Asterisk seven
’ agrees Ron
 though with a pronunciation of the word ‘asterisk’ very much his own
 ‘And that just leaves the four of us
 eh
 The only ones left on the list
’
Ibrahim looks down at the list and nods
‘Shall we
’ asks Ron
‘You think there is a chance one of us did it
’
‘I didn’t do it
 that’s for sure
’ says Ron
 ‘They can redevelop what they like
 more the merrier
 far as I’m concerned
’
‘And yet you led the objections at the public meeting
 you lobbied the council and you started the barricade
 All designed to stop the redevelopment
’
‘Of course
’ says Ron
 as if his friend has lost his mind
 ‘No one takes liberties with me
 And when else do you get the chance to cause a bit of trouble when you’re nearly eighty
 But
 mate
 think of the service charge
 the new facilities
 Probably won’t happen now
 No way I’d have killed him
 that’d be cutting off my nose
 Score me a four
’
Ibrahim shakes his head
 ‘You get a seven
 You are very combative
 you are hot-headed
 often irrational
 you were there at the heart of the scuffle and you are insulin-dependent
 so you know how to use a needle
 That adds up
’
Ron nods
 fair enough
 ‘All right
 let’s call me a six
’
Ibrahim taps his pen against his book seven times
 before looking up
 ‘And your son
 I think
 perhaps knew Tony Curran a little
 Which adds up to seven
’
Ron is no longer in his place of peace and his ice cubes now dance a different jig
 He remains quiet
 if not calm
 ‘Don’t bring Jason into this
 Ibrahim
 You know better than that
’
Interesting
 thinks Ibrahim
 but says nothing
 ‘Are we scoring ourselves
 Ron
 or are we not scoring ourselves
’
Ron stares at his friend for a long while
 ‘We are
 we are
 you’re right
 Well if I’m a seven then you’re a seven too
’
‘That’s fine
’ says Ibrahim and writes it in his book
 ‘Any reason
’
So many reasons
 mate
 Ron thinks
 He is smiling now
 the tension broken
 ‘Too smart by half
 there’s one
 You might want to write these down
 You’re a psychopath
 or sociopath
 whichever one the bad one is
 Terrible handwriting
 that’s a sure sign
 You’re an immigrant
 and we’ve all read about them
 There’s some poor British psychiatrist
 a white fella
 sitting at home without a job because of you
 Also
 perhaps you’re furious that your hair is thinning
 people have killed over less
’
‘My hair isn’t thinning
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Ask Anthony about my hair
 He admires it
’
‘You were there
 right in the thick of it
 as usual
 And you’re exactly the sort of person in a film who would commit the perfect murder just to see if he could get away with it
’
‘That is certainly true
’ agrees Ibrahim
‘Played by Omar Sharif
’ adds Ron
‘Ah
 so we agree I have hair
 OK I am a seven
 Now
 Joyce and Elizabeth
’
Ibrahim relishes the thought of talking late into the night
 Once Ron goes
 all there will be to do is read
 to make more lists
 then force himself to lie on his bed waiting for a sleep that always takes too long to come
 Too many voices wanting his attention
 Too many people still lost in the dark
 asking for his help
Ibrahim knows he is usually the last person awake in Coopers Chase
 and tonight he is glad to have the excuse of company
 Two old men
 fighting against the night
Ibrahim opens his pad again and looks out of his window towards Joyce’s flat
 Darkness everywhere
 The village is asleep
Of course
 Elizabeth is too much of a professional to let her torch beam show on her walk back down the hill
67
Jason Ritchie sits at a corner table
 finishing his lunch
 Monkfish and pancetta
 both locally sourced
He doesn’t know quite what to do
Jason is surprised by the changes in the Black Bridge
 It is now a gastropub called Le Pont Noir
 with its name written
 black against grey
 in minimalist lower-case font
 Some of the rough edges have been really been knocked off Fairhaven over the years
 some of the darker corners have gone
You and me both
 Jason thinks
 as he sips his sparkling water
Jason is thinking about the photograph
 He would feel a lot safer with a gun
 and twenty years ago that would have been easy
 He would have walked into the Black Bridge
 talked to Mickey Landsdowne
 who would have rung Geoff Goff and
 before he’d finished his pint
 a kid on a BMX would have delivered a brown parcel to the saloon bar and been given a packet of crisps and twenty B&H for his troubles
Simpler times
Now Mickey Landsdowne was in Wandsworth for arson
 and for selling fake Viagra at car-boot fairs
Geoff Goff had tried to buy Fairhaven Town FC
 lost his money in a property crash
 made another fortune selling stolen copper and had eventually been shot dead on a jet ski
And did kids even ride BMXs any more
The photograph lies in front of Jason on the table
 Taken in the Black Bridge long ago
 In the days before pancetta and sourdough bread
The gang
 just like it was yesterday
 Laughing away like trouble wasn’t round the next corner
Ever since he sat down
 Jason has been trying to work out exactly where in the pub Tony Curran had shot that drug dealer down from London
 trying his luck in sleepy Fairhaven
 In about 2000
 was it
 It was hard because they had moved a wall
 but he thinks perhaps it was by the reclaimed fireplace
 with the locally sourced logs
‘Coffee
 sir
’ The waitress
 Jason orders a flat white
Jason remembers that the bullet had gone through the guy’s stomach
 straight through the paper-thin wall and out into the car park
 where it went through the front wing of Turkish Gianni’s Cosworth RS500
 Gianni was gutted
 you could see it
 but it was Tony
 so what could he do
Turkish Gianni
 Jason has been thinking about him a lot
 He is sure Gianni had taken the photograph which had been left by the body
 Always had that camera with him
 Did the police know
 Had Gianni come back to town
 Had Bobby Tanner come back
 Was Jason next on their list
The boy Tony shot had died in the end
 They had often come down from London in those days
 Sometimes south London
 sometimes north
 gangs looking to expand
 to find soft new markets
The waitress brings his flat white
 With an almond biscotto
Jason still remembers the boy Tony had shot
 He was only a kid
 He’d offered a wrap of coke to Steve Georgiou
 in the Oak on the seafront
 Steve Georgiou was a Cypriot lad
 used to hang around on the fringes of the gang
 never liked to get involved
 but was loyal
 Owned a gym now
 Steve Georgiou had set him up
 told the young drug dealer to try his luck at the Black Bridge
 Which the boy had done
 before quickly realizing his luck was out
He was bleeding a lot
 Jason remembers that
 and it wasn’t fun
 he remembers that too
 Thinking back
 the kid must have been about seventeen
 which seems young now
 but didn’t at the time
 Someone put him in Bobby Tanner’s old British Telecom van
 and a cabbie Tony liked to use in this sort of situation drove him out to the ‘Welcome to Fairhaven’ sign on the A2102 and dumped him there
 That’s where they found him the next morning
 Too late for the boy
 he was long dead
 but he’d known the risks
 The cabbie got shot too
 because Tony thought you could never be too careful
That had been the end of things for Jason
 The end of it for all of them
 really
 It was no longer young men making money
 friends having fun
 pretending to be Robin Hood
 or whatever he had thought it was at the time
 It was bullets and dead bodies and police and grieving parents
 He’d been an idiot
 He’d spotted it all too late
Bobby Tanner left soon after
 His younger brother
 Troy
 had died on a boat in the Channel
 Bringing drugs in
 Jason never found out
 Gianni did a runner too
 straight after the cabbie was shot
 And that was that
 Just like that
 with one bullet
 those days were gone
 And good riddance to them
They say two brothers from St Leonards now run things in Fairhaven
 Good luck to them
 thinks Jason
 Still keeping it locally sourced
He walks over to the fireplace
 then crouches
 Yep
 this was the place all right
 He runs his finger across the reproduction antique tiles
 Take them off
 keep scraping and you’d find a little hole Mickey Landsdowne had filled in and painted over
 twenty-odd years ago
 The one bullet that changed everything
There was nothing left here now
 in the Black Bridge
 with its memories and with its green tea with ginseng
 All the gang gone
 Tony Curran
 Mickey Landsdowne
 Geoff Goff
 Where’s that Cosworth with a hole
 now
 Rusting somewhere in a field
 And where was Bobby Tanner
 Where was Gianni
 How could he find them before they found him
Jason sits back down and sips his flat white
 Well
 he supposes
 he probably knows the answer to that
 Has known it all along
Jason sighs
 dips his biscotto into his flat white and calls his dad
68
‘I got the photo on the Tuesday morning
’ says Jason Ritchie
 ‘Hand-delivered
 through the letter box
’
Father and son are drinking from bottles of beer on Ron’s balcony
‘And you recognized it
’ asks Ron
‘Well
 not the photo
 I’d never seen the photo before
 But I recognized what it was
 where it was
 all that
’ says Jason
‘And what was it
 And where was it
 And all that
’ asks his dad
Jason takes out the photograph and shows it to Ron
‘Here you are
 It’s Tony Curran
 Bobby Tanner and me
 The three of us around the table in the Black Bridge
 that’s where we used to drink
 Remember
 I took you there once
 when you came down
’
Ron nods and looks at the photo
 In front of the little gang
 the table is covered in cash
 Thousands
 twenty-five grand maybe
 all in notes
 just scattered about
 And the boys all looking pleased about it
‘And where was the money from
’ asks Ron
‘That time
 No idea
 it was one evening out of many
’
‘But drugs
’ asks his dad
‘Drugs
 Always
 in those days
’ confirms Jason
 ‘That’s where I put my money
 To keep it safe
’
Ron nods and Jason holds out his palms
 no defence
‘And the police have got the photo
’ asks Ron
‘Yep
 they’ve got plenty more on me too
’
‘You know I’ve got to ask
 Jason
 Did you kill Tony Curran
’
Jason shakes his head
 ‘I didn’t
 Dad
 and I’d tell you if I did
 because you know there’d have been a good reason if I had
’
Ron nods
 ‘Can you prove you didn’t do it
’
‘If I can find Bobby Tanner or Gianni
 then I reckon
 It’s one of them
 I can understand someone else leaving the photo by the body
 you know
 red herring for the cops to find
 But why send it to me too
 Unless Bobby or Gianni want me to know they did it
’
‘And you’re not talking to the police
’
‘You know me
 I thought I’d find them myself
’
‘And how’s that going
’
Well
 that’s why I’m here
 isn’t it
 Dad
’
Ron nods
 ‘I’ll call Elizabeth
’

Donna and Chris are in Fairhaven Police Station
 Interview Suite B
Not so long ago Donna had been sitting in this interview room talking to someone pretending to be a nun
 She now sat in front of a man pretending to be a priest
 The parallel was not lost on her
Donna herself had made the breakthrough
 Just a few background checks on Father Matthew Mackie
 Run him through the computer
 see what popped up
The background checks had taken a couple of days
 because nothing at all had popped up
 Which had made no sense at all
 So Donna had spent a bit of time piecing it together
 working out what was what
 before taking the information to Chris
 And now here they all were
‘At every step of the process
 Mr Mackie
’ Chris continues
 ‘At every step
 you referred to yourself as “Father”
 You introduced yourself as “Father”
’
‘Yes
’ agrees Matthew Mackie
‘Even now
 you’re wearing a dog collar
 are we agreed
’
‘I am
 yes
’ Mackie fingers the dog collar in confirmation
‘And the rest
 The full kit
 if you like
’
‘The vestments
 yes
’
‘And yet
 when we start looking into you
 what do we find
 do you think
’
Donna watches and learns
 Chris is being gentle with the old man
 She wonders if he will turn
 given what they know
‘I think … well
 I think perhaps
 possibly
 there may have been a misapprehension
’ Chris sits back and lets Matthew Mackie talk
 Which he does in fits and starts
 ‘For which I accept my share of the blame
 and if you feel I have … fallen short
 I suppose
 in some way
 my intentions were not to mislead
 but I see that that’s how it might look
 without all the
 uh
 facts
’
‘The facts
 Mr Mackie
’ says Chris
 ‘Excellent! Let’s get on to the facts
 You are not Father Matthew Mackie
 that’s a fact
 You do not work for the Catholic Church
 or any church
 That’s another one
 You are
 and this has taken a full fifteen minutes of research with the local NHS Trust
 Doctor Michael Matthew Noel Mackie
 Can we have that one as a fact too
’
‘Yes
’ admits Matthew Mackie
‘You retired from private practice as a GP fifteen years ago
 You live in a bungalow in Bexhill and
 asking around there
 you don’t even attend Mass
’
Matthew Mackie looks to the floor
‘All facts
’
Mackie nods without looking up
 ‘All facts
’
‘I wonder if you could remove the dog collar for me
 Mr Mackie
’
Mackie looks up
 and directly at Chris
 ‘No
 I’ll keep it on if you don’t mind
 Unless I’m under arrest
 which you haven’t mentioned
’
Now Chris nods
 He looks over at Donna
 then turns back and drums his fingers on the table
 Here we go
 thinks Donna
 It takes a lot to get Chris to drum his fingers on a table
‘A man has just died
 Mr Mackie
’ says Chris
 ‘And you and I watched it happen
 didn’t we
 And do you know what I thought I saw
 I thought I saw a man pushing a Catholic priest
 A Catholic priest protecting a Catholic graveyard
 And
 as a police officer
 that painted things in a certain light for me
 You understand
’
Mackie nods
 Donna is staying quiet
 There is nothing she can think to add
 She wonders if Chris would ever drum his fingers on a table at her
 She hopes not
‘But what did I actually see
 I actually saw a man pushing someone impersonating a priest
 for reasons still known only to himself
 Pushing a conman
 which is what you are
 A conman protecting a graveyard
’
‘I’m not a conman
’ says Matthew Mackie
Chris holds up a hand to stop him
 ‘Moments after scuffling with this conman
 the first man drops down dead from a lethal injection
 Which puts a different complexion on things
 especially when we discover the conman is a doctor
 But perhaps I’ve missed something
’
Mackie remains silent
‘I’m just going to ask you again
 sir
 I wonder if you could remove the dog collar for me
’
‘I am not presently a father
 I grant you that
’ says Mackie with a long sigh
 ‘But I was
 and for many years
 And that confers privileges and this collar is one
 If I choose to wear it
 and if I still choose to call myself Father Mackie
 then that is my business
’
‘Doctor Mackie
’ says Chris
 ‘this is a murder case
 I need you to stop lying to me
 PC De Freitas here has been through every record
 The Church has been very helpful
 Whatever you’ve said to us
 whatever you said to the council
 to Ian Ventham
 to the ladies who protected the gate
 you are not a priest and you never were a priest
 There is no record anywhere
 no dusty ledger
 no old photo
 I have no idea why you are lying to us
 but we have ourselves a dead body and we’re looking for a murderer
 so it’s probably best that we find out quickly
 If I’m missing something important
 I need you to tell me
’
Mackie looks at Chris for a moment
 thinking
 Then shakes his head
‘Only if you arrest me
’ replies Mackie
 ‘Otherwise
 I’d like to go home now
 And no hard feelings
 I know you are doing your job
’
Matthew Mackie crosses himself and stands
 Chris stands too
‘I would stay
 Doctor Mackie
 if I were you
’
‘The moment you charge me
 I promise I will
’ says Mackie
 ‘But
 in the meantime …’
Donna stands and opens the interview room door for him and Matthew Mackie takes his leave
70
It can be very hard to smoke in a sauna
 but Jason Ritchie is giving it his best shot
‘Are you sure you’re OK with this
 Dad
’ he asks
 sweat dripping from his brow
‘Just tell them everything
’ replies Ron
 ‘They’ll know what to do
’
‘And you reckon they’ll find them
’ asks Jason
‘I should have thought so
’ says Ibrahim
 stretched out on a lower bench
The sauna door opens and Elizabeth and Joyce enter
 with towels wrapped around swimsuits
 Jason puts out his cigarette in a pile of hot ash
‘Well
 this is nice
’ says Joyce
 ‘Eucalyptus
’
‘Nice to see you
 Jason
’ says Elizabeth
 taking a seat opposite the half-naked boxer
 ‘I believe you think that we might be of use to you
 I must say
 I agree
’
That’s it for pleasantries
 Elizabeth fixes her eyes on Jason
‘So
’
Jason tells Elizabeth and Joyce the same story he told his dad
 A copy of the photo is passed around the sauna
 Ibrahim has had it laminated
‘I get the photo
’ confirms Jason
 ‘and I’m
 like
 what’s this about
 Where’s this from
 Is this the papers
 Is this the front page of the Sun tomorrow
 That’s what I was thinking
 But there’s no message
 nothing
 There’s no journalist on the phone
 and they’ve got a number for me
 so what’s up
’
‘And what was up
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Well
 I’m thinking
 do I ring my PR
 Maybe they’ve spoken to her
 I was in shock
 to be fair
 this is twenty-odd years ago
 this photo
 and a world I’d left behind
 So I’m ready to deny whatever
 or come up with something
 stag-do
 fancy dress
 anything to explain it away
’
‘Ooh
 that’s good
’ says Joyce
‘So there I am
 still looking at his picture
 and something clicks
 I think
 well maybe this is the game
 Maybe Tony’s got hold of this photo
 famous boxer
 surrounded by cash
 jailbirds everywhere
 He sends me a copy
 looking for a bit of money
 Give me twenty K
 whatever
 and I don’t go to the papers
 Fair enough
 really
 so I think
 yeah
 I should just ring him
 have a little chat
 See if we can work something out
’
‘Was Tony Curran the sort of man who might blackmail you
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Tony’s the sort of man who might do anything
 yeah
 So
 first things first
 I get hold of a new phone
 cheap one
 in town
’
‘Afterwards
 will you tell me where
 because I’m looking for one at the moment
’ says Ibrahim
‘Of course
 Mr Arif
’ says Jason
 ‘So
 I ring him once
 and no answer
 I ring him again – same
 leave it twenty minutes and try again
 He’s still not picking up
’
‘I never pick up if it’s a number I don’t recognize
’ says Joyce
 ‘I saw that on Rogue Traders
’
‘Very wise
 Joyce
’ continues Jason
 ‘Then I came here for a quick drink with Pops and I saw the man himself
 Curran
 arguing with Ventham
’
‘Keeping all this quiet from me
’ says Ron
 and Jason raises his hand to acknowledge it
‘So after me and Dad had a couple of beers …’
‘And me
’ says Joyce
‘And Joyce
’ agrees Jason
 ‘After that
 I went for a little drive
 just to do a bit of thinking
 Then I headed down there
 Tony’s house
 lovely place
 Now
 we’re always cautious around each other
 me and Tony
 too many secrets
 but I wouldn’t be at his front door without a reason
 His car’s on the drive
 so when there’s no answer
 I think he’s seen me on his security and doesn’t fancy a chat
 And I didn’t blame him
 so I rang the bell a few more times and then I left
’
‘And this is the day he died
’ asks Joyce
‘The day he died
 I couldn’t hear anything from inside
 so I don’t know if that was before or after or whatever
 Anyway
 home I go and a couple of hours later I’m on this WhatsApp group …’
‘A WhatsApp group
’ asks Elizabeth
 but Joyce waves her away and Jason continues
‘A few of the old faces
 and someone says Tony’s been found dead at home
 I go cold
 you know
 I get sent the photo that morning and Tony dies that afternoon
 Which leaves me worried
 I mean
 I can look after myself
 but Tony could look after himself too
 and see where that got him
 So I’m nervous
 that’s natural
 and then the police get wind that I’ve been to Tony’s and they get records saying I’d rung Tony’s phone that day too
 And they’ve got a photo of me that was left by the body
 You can’t blame them
 they think that stinks and so would I
’
‘But you didn’t kill Tony Curran
’ asks Elizabeth
‘No
 not me
’ says Jason
 ‘But you can see why the police think I did
’
‘Their case is compelling
’ agrees Ibrahim
‘And you’re here to see if we can find your old friend for you
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Well
’ says Jason
 ‘the way my dad tells it
 however good the police are
 you lot are better
’
There are quiet nods all round
‘And it’s old friends
’ says Jason
 ‘There’s the lad who took the photo too
’
‘And who was that
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Turkish Gianni
 the fourth member of our little gang
’
‘And he’s Turkish
’ asks Joyce
‘No
’ says Jason
Ibrahim notes this down
‘He’s Turkish Cypriot and scarpered back there years ago
’
‘I know some good operatives in Cyprus
’ says Elizabeth
‘Look
’ says Jason
 ‘You owe me nothing
 Less than that
 I’ve done nothing good here and Tony never did
 But if Bobby or Gianni killed Tony
 then they’re still out there
 and if they’re still out there
 then why not me next
 Again
 not your business
 I know
 but Dad thought it might be up your street
 and I’m not going to turn down the help
’
‘So … what do you reckon
’ Ron asks
‘Well
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Here’s my take
 The others might disagree
 though I suspect they won’t
 This is a mess of your own making
 And a mess that came from greed and from drugs
 And those are downsides for me
 But there is an upside too
 And that is that you are Ron’s son
 And I believe you are probably right
 I believe we can find Bobby Tanner and Turkish Gianni for you
 Probably quickly
 And whatever you’ve done
 and whatever we might think of that
 I would like to catch a murderer
 Before that murderer catches you
’
‘Agreed
’ says Joyce
‘Agreed
’ says Ibrahim
‘Thank you
’ says Jason
‘Thank you
’ adds Ron
‘Not at all
’ says Elizabeth
 standing
 ‘Now
 I will leave you to your sauna
 I have to make a few calls
 Ron
 I need to see you at the graveyard at ten this evening
 if you’re free
 Joyce and Ibrahim
 I’ll need you there too
’
‘Sounds lovely
 Wouldn’t miss it
’ says Ron
 His son gives him a questioning look
‘And Jason
’ says Elizabeth
‘Yes
’ says Jason
‘If this is a bluff
 it’s a high-risk one
 Because we will catch this murderer
 Even if it’s you
’
71
‘Do you need a hand to get down into the grave
’ asks Ibrahim
‘Yes
 please
’ says Austin
 ‘that would be terribly kind of you
’
Bogdan has borrowed an arc light and it is trained on the grave he had opened on the morning that Ian Ventham was murdered
 The grave that had revealed an extra occupant on top of the coffin
 A skeleton
 buried where it had no right to be buried
Austin holds on to Ibrahim’s arm and takes a step down into the grave
 He is careful not to step on the bones scattered on the lip of the coffin
 He looks up at Elizabeth and chuckles
 ‘This takes me back
 Lizzie
 Remember Leipzig
’
Elizabeth smiles
 she certainly does remember
 Joyce also smiles
 because she has never heard Elizabeth called Lizzie before
 She wonders if the others caught it
‘Whaddaya think
 Prof
’ asks Ron
 sitting happily at the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ
 and drinking from a can of Stella
‘Well
 I wouldn’t ordinarily like to say
’ replies Austin
 raising his glasses to get a closer look at the femur he is now holding
 ‘but if I were a gossip
 among friends
 of course
 I would say these have been down here some while
’
‘Some while
 Austin
’ asks Elizabeth
‘I would say so
’ considers Austin
 ‘Just by the colouration
’
‘And if you were being more specific
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Well
 goodness!’ says Austin
 ‘If you want me to be specific
 I would say …’ He takes a moment to calibrate his thoughts
 ‘I would say really quite some while indeed
’
‘So they could have been buried at the same time as Sister Margaret
’ asks Joyce
‘What’s the date on the headstone
’ asks Austin
‘Eighteen seventy-four
’ reads Joyce
‘Not a chance
 Thirty
 forty
 fifty years perhaps
 depending on the soil
 but not a hundred and fifty
’
‘So at some point
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘somebody has dug up this grave
 buried another body in it and then filled it in again
’
‘Certainly
’ agrees Austin
 ‘You have yourselves a mystery
’
‘Another nun
 perhaps
 Austin
’ asks Elizabeth
 ‘Any jewellery down there
 Any fragments of clothing
’
‘Not a thing on this one
’ says Austin
 ‘Stripped bare
 If it was murder
 then someone knew what they were doing
 I’m going to take a few bones with me
 if you don’t mind
’ I’ll have a little look at them in the morning
 just to give you a clearer picture
’
‘Absolutely
 Austin
 take your pick
’ says Elizabeth
Bogdan blows out his cheeks
 ‘So we got to tell police now
’
‘Oh
 I think we can probably keep this to ourselves until Austin gets back to us
’ replies Elizabeth
 ‘If everyone agrees
’
Everyone agrees
‘Someone give me a hand out of the grave
’ says Austin
 ‘Bogdan
 old chap
’
Bogdan nods
 but seems to want to get something clear first
 ‘Listen
 I just need to say one thing
 Is OK
 In case maybe I go mad
 This is not normal
 Right
 An old man in a grave looking at bones
 Someone is murdered maybe
 but no one tells the police
’
‘Bogdan
 you didn’t tell the police when you first dug up the bones
’ says Joyce
‘Yes
 but I am me
’ says Bogdan
 ‘I’m not normal
’
‘Well
 we’re us
’ says Joyce
 ‘and we’re not normal either
 Although I did use to be
’
‘Normal is an illusory concept
 Bogdan
’ adds Ibrahim
‘Bogdan
 trust us
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘We just want to find out whose these remains might be and who buried them
 and that will be a lot easier without the police poking their noses in until absolutely necessary
 If the police have the bones first
 you can bet that will be the last we hear about them
 And that seems unfair
 after all our hard work
’
‘I trust you
’ says Bogdan
 then screws up his face as a thought occurs
 ‘Though if it goes wrong I bet it’s me sent to prison
’
‘I won’t let that happen
 you’re too useful
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Now
 please help Austin out of the grave and grab those bones for me
 I suggest we all go back to Joyce’s for a nice cup of tea
’
‘Splendid!’ says Austin
 placing his selection of bones on the lip of the grave before reaching out for Bogdan’s arms
‘You lead the way
 Lizzie
’ says Ron and finishes off his can of Stella
72
Joyce
There was a jolly atmosphere
 and I can understand the reasons why
 We each of us understand we’re in a gang and we understand we are in the middle of something unusual
 We understand also
 I think
 that we are doing something illegal
 but we are past the age of caring
 Perhaps we are raging against the dying of the light
 but that is poetry
 not life
 There will be other reasons I have missed out
 but I know on the walk back down the hill we felt giddy
 Like teenagers out too late
But when Austin laid the pile of bones on my dining table
 while we still knew it was an adventure
 I think they began to have a sobering effect on all of us
 Even Ron
It is all very well
 the Thursday Murder Club and all our derring-do
 and the freedom of age and whatever we like to tell ourselves
 But someone had died
 however long ago it might have happened
 so it was right to pause for reflection
There was no way around it
 we couldn’t conjure a single good reason why the extra body was there
 On closer inspection
 fuelled by orange drizzle cake (Nigella)
 Austin was fairly sure that the body was a man
 so it wasn’t a nun
But who was he
 And who had killed him
 The first step to finding out the answers would be to discover when he had been killed
 Thirty years ago
 Fifty years ago
 There was a big difference
Austin explained he would take the bones away and do further tests
 After everybody had left
 I googled him and it turns out he is a Sir
 I can’t say I was surprised
 he really did know a great deal about bones
 Quite what he made of standing in a grave
 at ten at night
 in his eighties
 is his business
 but I suppose any friend of Elizabeth is probably used to these things
 Three sugars in his tea too
 though you wouldn’t know by looking at him
And then the biggest question of all
 of course
 You’ll be ahead of me here
 Had the motive been found for one much more recent murder
 Did someone else know the bones were hidden there
 Was Ian Ventham killed to protect the Garden of Eternal Rest and the secret of those bones
We talked for around an hour
 I suppose
 Were we right not to involve the police
 We will have to tell them eventually
 but the feeling was that this is our story
 our graveyard
 our home and
 just for the time being
 we wanted to keep it for ourselves
 As soon as we get the results from Austin we will have to tell all
 of course
So we are trying to solve two murders
 and possibly three
 if the skeleton was murdered
 Or
 I should say
 if the skeleton is of someone who was murdered
 Is a skeleton a person
 That’s a question for greater minds than mine
I know Elizabeth is keen to track down Bobby and Gianni
 but we all agreed the bones have to take precedence for now
I wonder if Chris and Donna are making any progress
 We certainly haven’t heard if they are
 I do hope they’re not keeping anything from us
73
Chris and Donna are walking the three flights of stairs up to Chris’s office
 Donna has pretended to be frightened of lifts
 to force Chris to walk
‘So
 Jason Ritchie for the Tony Curran murder
’ says Chris
 ‘And Matthew Mackie for Ian Ventham
’
‘Unless we’re missing something
’ says Donna
‘I wouldn’t put that past us
’ says Chris
 ‘So
 let’s work it through
 We know Matthew Mackie was there and we know he’s a liar
 He’s a doctor
 not a priest
’
‘So we know he could get hold of fentanyl and he’d know how to use it
’ says Donna
‘Agreed
’ says Chris
 ‘I think we’ve got everything except a motive
’
‘Well
 he doesn’t want the graveyard moved
’ says Donna
 ‘Is that enough
’
‘Not enough to arrest him
 Unless we find out why he doesn’t want it moved
’
‘Is impersonating a priest a crime
’ asks Donna
 ‘Someone I met on Tinder once pretended he was a pilot and tried to grope me outside an All Bar One
’
‘I bet he regretted that
’
‘I punched him in the balls
 then called in his reg number and got him breathalysed on the way home
’
They both smile
 But the smiles are fleeting
 Both know they are in danger of letting Matthew Mackie slip between their fingers
 No evidence whatsoever
‘Have you heard anything from your pals in the Thursday Murder Club
’ asks Chris
‘Not a peep
’ says Donna
 ‘Which makes me nervous
’
‘Me too
’ says Chris
 ‘And I really don’t want to be the one to tell them about Jason Ritchie
’
Chris pauses for a moment on the landing
 Pretending to think
 but really just to catch his breath
‘Perhaps Mackie’s got something buried in the graveyard
’ says Chris
 ‘Doesn’t want it dug up
’
‘Good place to bury something
’ agrees Donna
74
Joyce
Have you ever used Skype
I hadn’t until this morning
 and now I have
 Ibrahim set it up
 and so we had gone round to his
 He keeps his flat so clean
 and I don’t think he has anyone in to do it
There are files everywhere
 but all locked away
 so you can see them but not read them
 Imagine the stories you must hear if you’re a therapist
 Who did what to who
 Or is it
 whom did what to who
 Either way
 I bet he’s heard all sorts
Austin rang at ten on the dot
 as you would expect from a Sir
 and told us what he knew
 We could see him on screen
 and we took it in turns to go in the little box in the corner
 It was hard
 because the box is very small
 but I expect you get used to it if you do it a few times
The body was a man
 which he’d already told us
 He had a gunshot wound to the femur
 Austin held it up to show us
 We all tried to get in the box for that bit
 Had that been the wound that killed him
 Austin wouldn’t like to say for certain
 but probably not
 A pre-existing injury
At one point his wife walked past in the background
 What must she think
 Her husband holding up bones to a computer screen
 Perhaps she is used to it
Now
 how much do you know about how to tell how old bones are
 I knew nothing
 and Austin went through the whole thing in detail
 It was fascinating
 There was a machine
 and there was a special dye
 and something to do with carbon
 I tried to remember this all the way home so I could write it down
 but I’m afraid it’s gone
 But it was very interesting
 He would be very good on The One Show if they ever needed it
He’d taken some soil with him too
 and done tests on that
 but the soil stuff was less interesting
 Back to the bones
 please
 I had been thinking
The long and short of it
 though
 is that Austin had done some maths
 and you can’t be certain
 and there were variables
 and no one has all the answers
 and all he could really do was make his best guess
 At this point Elizabeth told him to stop prattling on and get to it
 Elizabeth can get away with that sort of thing
 even to a Sir
So he came out with it
 The body was buried sometime in the 1970s
 probably earlier rather than later
 So fifty-odd years ago
 give or take
We thanked Austin
 but then no one knew how to hang up
 Ibrahim tried for a while and you could see he was losing face
 In the end Austin’s wife came to the rescue his end
 She seems lovely
So there we had it
 Two potential murders fifty years apart
 Plenty to chew on for everyone there
 And probably time to tell Chris and Donna what we have done
 I hope they don’t take it too personally
Elizabeth then asked if I would like to go to a crematorium in Brighton with her today
 on a hunch
 but I had already said that I would cook lunch for Bernard
 so nothing doing
I know you can’t smell it
 but I’m making him steak and kidney
 He is getting thin
 so I’m just seeing what I can do
75
Donna and Chris are waiting for their free coffee at the Wild Bean Café inside the BP garage on the A21
 Anything to get out of the station for half an hour
 To stop looking at the endless files from the Irish passport office
 Chris picks up a chocolate bar
‘Chris
 you don’t need that
’ says Donna
Chris gives her a look
‘Please
’ says Donna
 ‘Let me help
 I know it’s hard
’
Chris nods and puts the chocolate bar back
‘So
 what’s in it for Mackie
’ asks Donna
 ‘What’s the connection with the graveyard
 Why protect it if he’s not a priest
’
Chris shrugs
 ‘Perhaps it’s just a way of getting to Ventham
 Perhaps there’s another connection between them
 Have we looked at Doctor Mackie’s patient lists
 You never know
’
Chris then picks up a cereal bar
‘That’s even worse than a chocolate bar
’ says Donna
 ‘Even more sugar
’
Chris puts it back down
 He’s going to be forced to eat a piece of fruit at this rate
‘He’s dodgy as hell
’ says Chris
 ‘All we’re missing is his motive
’
Donna’s phone buzzes and she reads a message
 She purses her lips and looks up at Chris
‘It’s Elizabeth
 She wonders if we might like to pop over this evening
’
‘I think that might have to wait
’ says Chris
 ‘Tell her we’re busy solving two murders
’
Donna continues to scroll through the message
 ‘She says she has something for us
 I quote “Please do not read another file until you have seen what we have found
 Also there will be sherry
 See you at eight
”’ Donna puts her phone in her pocket and looks at her boss
‘Well
’ she asks
Well
 Chris slowly strokes his stubble and considers the Thursday Murder Club
 He has to face it
 he likes them
 He’s happy drinking their tea
 eating their cake and chatting off the record
 He likes their rolling hills and their big sky
 Was he being taken advantage of
 Well
 almost certainly
 but
 for now
 he was getting plenty in return
 Would this all look very bad if it came out
 Yes
 but it won’t
 And
 if it did
 why not just take Elizabeth into his disciplinary hearing and let her work her magic
Eventually he looks up at Donna
 who has her eyebrows raised waiting for an answer
‘I’m a reluctant yes
’
76
‘Now we can do this one of two ways
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘You can kick up a fuss and curse us to the heavens and we can all waste a lot of time
 Or you can just accept what has happened and we can enjoy our sherry and get on with this
 Your choice
’
Chris cannot speak for a moment
 He looks at the four of them
 Then to the air
 then to the floor
 Looking for words that don’t want to come
 He holds the flat of a palm in the air in front of him
 in an effort to pause reality for the briefest of moments
 But no luck
‘You …
’ he begins
 slowly
 ‘you … dug up a body
’
‘Well
 technically we didn’t dig it up
’ says Ibrahim
‘But a body was dug up
 yes
’ says Chris
Elizabeth and Joyce nod
 Elizabeth takes a sip of her sherry
‘That’s the long and short of it
’ confirms Joyce
‘And you then performed a forensic analysis on the bones
’
‘Well
 again
 not us personally
 And only on some of them
’ says Ibrahim
‘Oh
 that’s fine then
 Just a few
’ Chris’s voice is raised
 and Donna realizes it’s the first time she’s experienced this
 ‘Then I wish you all a good evening
 Nothing to see here
’
‘I knew you’d get melodramatic
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Can we just get this over with and move on to business
’
Donna steps in
‘Melodramatic
’ she addresses Elizabeth directly
 ‘Elizabeth
 you just dug up a human body and failed to report it to the police
 This isn’t pretending to be a nun who’s had her bag stolen
’
‘What nun
’ asks Chris
‘Nothing
’ says Donna quickly
 ‘This is a serious crime
 Elizabeth
 you could all go to jail for this
’
‘Nonsense
’ says Elizabeth
‘Far from nonsense
’ says Chris
 ‘What on earth are you doing
 I need you to think very carefully about what you say next
 Why did you dig up a body
 Let’s take this step by step
’
‘Well
 as I stated previously
 we didn’t dig up the body
 But our attention was drawn to the fact that a body had been dug up
’ says Ibrahim
‘And we were curious
 naturally
’ says Ron
‘Our attention was grabbed
’ agrees Ibrahim
‘What with the murder of Ian Ventham
’ adds Joyce
 ‘it seemed it might be important
’
‘You didn’t think Donna and me might have been interested at this point
’ asks Chris
‘Firstly
 Chris
 it’s “Donna and I”
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And secondly
 who knew what the bones were
 We didn’t want to waste your time until we knew for sure what we were dealing with
 What if we’d called you out and they were nothing but cow bones
 Wouldn’t we have looked silly old fools then
’
‘We wouldn’t have wanted to waste your time
’ agrees Ibrahim
 ‘We know you are busy with two murders already
’
‘But off they went for analysis
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘And back it comes
 human bones
 good to have it confirmed
 no cost to the taxpayer
 Male
 died sometime in the 1970s
 a gunshot wound to the leg
 but no way of telling if that’s what killed him
 Now to invite Chris and Donna to take a look
 and to lead things from here
 Get the professionals in
 It really feels like you might be thanking us
’
Chris is trying to compose a response
 Donna decides that this one might be her responsibility
‘Christ
 Elizabeth
 just give it a rest for one second
 You can drop the act with us
 The second you dug up that body you knew they were human bones
 because I think you can tell the difference
 Joyce
 you were a nurse for forty years
 do you know the difference between human bones and cow bones
’
‘Well
 yes
’ admits Joyce
‘The second you did that
 Elizabeth
 you and your whole gang …’
‘We are not Elizabeth’s gang
’ interrupts Ibrahim
Donna raises her eyebrows at Ibrahim
 who holds up a hand in concession
 She continues
 ‘The lot of you
 from that moment
 were in deep
 deep trouble
 This is not a neat little trick
 You might fool the rest of the world
 but you don’t fool me
 You’re not plucky underdogs
 or helpful amateurs
 This is a serious crime
 This is bigger than a serious crime
 And this doesn’t end with us all giggling over a glass of sherry
 It ends in a courtroom
 How could you be so stupid
 The four of you
 We’re friends
 and you treat me like this
’
Elizabeth sighs
 ‘Well this is exactly what I meant
 Donna
 I knew you’d both make a fuss
’
‘A fuss!’ says Donna incredulously
‘Yes
 a fuss
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And I do understand
 in the circumstances
’
‘Just doing your job
’ agrees Ron
‘Admirable
 if you want my opinion
’ adds Ibrahim
‘But the fuss ends here
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘If you’re going to arrest us
 arrest us
 Take the four of us to the station
 question us all night
 Get the same answer all night
’
‘No comment
’ says Ron
‘No comment
’ says Ibrahim
‘Like on 24 Hours in Police Custody
’ says Joyce
‘You don’t know who dug the body up and you won’t hear the answer from any of us
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘You don’t know who took the bones away for analysis and you won’t hear that from us either
 At the end of the evening you might try and explain to the CPS that four people in their seventies and eighties have failed to report digging up a body
 For what reason
 With what evidence
 other than the inadmissible confession you’ve taken from us this evening
 And with four suspects
 all of whom are quite happy to go to court
 smile happily and pretend to mistake the judge for their granddaughter and ask why she doesn’t visit often enough
 The whole process is difficult
 costly and time-consuming
 and achieves nothing
 No one is going to prison
 no one is getting a fine
 no one’s even going to be picking litter by the roadside
’
‘Not with my back
’ says Ron
‘Or
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘you can forgive us
 and believe us when we say we were trying to help
 You can let us apologize for our overenthusiasm
 because we did know what we were doing was wrong
 but we did it anyway
 We know you’ve spent the last twenty-four hours in the dark and we know we are in your debt
 And if you forgive us
 then tomorrow morning
 on a wild hunch
 you can order a search of the Garden of Eternal Rest
 You can dig up the body
 you can send it to your own forensics team
 who will tell you it’s a male who was almost certainly buried in the early 1970s
 and then we’ll all happily be on the same page
’
There is a moment’s silence
‘So
’ asks Chris
 very slowly
 ‘you’ve reburied the bones
’
‘We thought it was best
’ says Joyce
 ‘To give you the glory
’
‘I’d leave the grave in the top right-hand corner till about fourth or fifth
 if I were you
’ says Ron
 ‘Don’t want to make it too obvious
’
‘And in the meantime
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘we can all have a nice evening and no more shouting
 We can tell you everything we know
 So you can really hit the ground running in the morning
’
‘You could even share a bit of information with us if you thought that was appropriate
’ adds Ibrahim
‘How about some information about the custodial sentences you can get for perverting the course of justice
 Or disturbing a grave
’ says Chris
 ‘Up to ten years
 if you’re interested
’
‘Oh
 we just went through all this
 Chris
’ sighs Elizabeth
 ‘Stop grandstanding and swallow your pride
 And besides
 we’re not hampering
 we’re helping
’
‘I didn’t notice either of you digging up a body
’ adds Ron
 to Chris and Donna
‘We have certainly done an awful lot of the work so far
’ says Ibrahim
‘So this is how I see it
’ confirms Elizabeth
 ‘Either you arrest us
 which we would all understand
 and Joyce
 in fact
 I think would actually enjoy
’
‘No comment
’ says Joyce
 nodding happily
‘Or you don’t arrest us and we can spend the rest of the evening talking about exactly why someone buried a body
 on this hillside
 sometime in the 1970s
’
Chris looks at Donna
‘And we can also discuss whether that same person has just murdered Ian Ventham to keep it secret
’ says Elizabeth
Donna looks at Chris
 Chris has a question
‘So you think the same person might have committed two murders
 But nearly fifty years apart
’
‘It’s an interesting question
 isn’t it
’ asks Elizabeth
‘It’s an interesting question we could have been asking last night
’ says Chris
‘It might have been useful to know we could be looking out for someone who was right here in the 1970s and is still right here now
’ adds Donna
‘We really are sorry
’ says Joyce
 ‘But Elizabeth was adamant
 and you know Elizabeth
’
‘Let’s move on
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Put this behind us
’
‘Do we have a choice
 Elizabeth
’ asks Chris
‘Choice is overrated
 you’ll learn that as the years fly by
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Now
 to business
 What do you make of the priest
 I wonder
 Father Mackie
 Might he have been around when this place was a convent
’
‘I take it from that question that you haven’t been able to find out anything about Father Mackie
’ says Chris
 ‘Don’t tell me I’ve found a chink in your armour
’
‘My inquiries are ongoing
’ says Elizabeth
‘No need
 Elizabeth
 we’ve cracked that one for you
’ says Donna
 ‘It’s Doctor Mackie
 Not a priest
 never has been
 never will be
 A doctor in Ireland
 moved over here in the nineties
’
‘That’s very curious
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Why pretend to be a priest
’
‘Told you he was a wrong ’un
’ says Ron to Ibrahim
‘So
 he might have killed Ian Ventham
’ says Donna
 ‘And he’s certainly up to something
 But I doubt it’s because of your bones
’
‘Is it worth my pointing out any more that this is all confidential
’ says Chris
‘You are quite safe with us
 You know that
 don’t you
 Nothing ever leaves this room
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Shall we just forget this ever happened
 the business with the bones and what have you
 and pool our knowledge
’
‘I think we’ve pooled quite enough for one day
 Elizabeth
’ says Donna
‘Oh really
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And yet
 you haven’t even told us about the Tony Curran photograph yet
 We had to find that out for ourselves
’
Donna and Chris both look at Elizabeth
 Chris lets out a theatrical sigh
‘By way of a peace offering
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘perhaps you would like to know who took the photograph
’
Chris looks up to the heavens
 Or Joyce’s Artex ceiling
 ‘I would actually like to know that
 yes
’
‘Lad named Turkish Gianni
’ says Ron
‘Although he’s not Turkish
’ adds Joyce
‘You’ve seen the photo
 Ron
’ asks Donna
Ron nods
‘Nice one of Jason
 eh
’
‘You want my view
 for what it’s worth
’ says Ron
 ‘You find Turkish Gianni or Bobby Tanner
 you find Tony Curran’s killer
’
‘Well then
 if we’re laying all our cards on the table
’ says Chris
 ‘has Jason explained away his phone calls to Tony Curran on the morning of the murder
 And has he explained away the presence of his car in the area at the exact moment that Tony Curran was murdered
’
‘Yes
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘To our satisfaction
’
‘Anything you’d like to share
’ asks Donna
‘Listen
 I’ll get him to give you a bell and explain
 don’t worry
’ says Ron
 ‘But shall we get on and find this Gianni fella and Bobby Tanner
’
‘Just leave that with us
 please
’ says Chris
‘I think we’re unlikely to just leave that with you
 Chris
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘I’m ever so sorry
’
‘Would you like some sherry
’ asks Joyce
 ‘It’s only Sainsbury’s
 but it’s Taste the Difference
’
Chris sinks back into his chair and submits
‘If any of this ever gets back to my superintendent
 I will personally arrest you and march you into court myself
 I swear
 on my life
’
‘Chris
 no one will ever find out
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘You know how I used to make my living
’
‘Well
 not really
 if I’m honest
’
‘Exactly
’
As a complicit silence falls over the room
 it seems the evening’s drinking can now begin in earnest
‘I am very proud of how we all work together as a team
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Cheers
’
77
Joyce
I’m glad we told Chris and Donna about the bones
 It seems right
 Now everyone can keep an eye out
 Who was here in the 1970s and is still here today
 That should keep them all occupied for a bit
Everyone knows everything now and that seems fair
So where are Gianni and Bobby
 Now we’ve dealt with the bones
 I know Elizabeth will be thinking about how we track them down
 That’s right up her street
 isn’t it
 I will get a call in the morning and it will be
 ‘Joyce
 we’re going to Reading
’ or
 ‘Joyce
 we’re going to Inverness
 or Timbuktu
’ and bit by bit she’ll tell me why and before you know it we’ll be having a cup of tea with Bobby Tanner
 or a café au lait with Turkish Gianni
 You wait and see
 Tomorrow morning
 before 10 a
m
 Guaranteed
The only time I ever use my passport is when I need to pick up a parcel
 but I’ve just checked and it has three years left
 I remember when I first got it
 wondering if it would be my last ever
 The odds on it being renewed are with me now I think
 Anyway
 that’s just to say that if Gianni or Bobby Tanner are abroad somewhere
 then I wouldn’t put it past Elizabeth to hop on a plane
 We’re only a drive from Gatwick here
I could send Joanna a postcard
 ‘Who
 me
 Oh
 I’m in Cyprus for a couple of days
 Tracking down a fugitive
 Possibly armed
 but you mustn’t worry
’ Though no one sends postcards any more
 do they
 Joanna has shown me how to send photos on my phone
 but I’m beggared if it’s ever worked when I tried
 I just get that spinning circle
Perhaps I could ask Bernard to come along with me
 ‘A couple of days in the sun
 Last-minute thing
 We just fancied it
’ I think it might frighten the poor man to death
I don’t like to give up on a chase
 but Bernard seems to be drifting further and further away from me
 He was not a bundle of fun at lunch and there was plenty of steak and kidney left over
And don’t think I don’t know what the others think
 What they suspect
 They’ll be checking whether Bernard was here fifty years ago
 They haven’t spoken to me about it
 but you mark my words
 Check away
 don’t mind me
Timbuktu is a real place by the way
 Did you know that
 It came up in a quiz once
 Ibrahim will remember where it is
 but I did think that was interesting
78
Chris Hudson is cradling a whisky
 He likes a real log fire and they have a nice one in Le Pont Noir
 He’s never eaten here
 because who would he eat with
 but he likes the bar
 The fire has a vintage tile surround
 very tasteful
 If you’d asked him twenty years ago
 he would have imagined this was the sort of place he might live
 Leather armchair
 whisky on the go
 wife reading some sort of book opposite him
 Something prize-winning and beyond him
 but she’d be turning the pages
 smiling wryly
 A love story set against the backdrop of the Raj
 He could be looking at murder case notes
 Slowly solving something
He is still sure that Mackie is guilty as hell
 It added up
 But these bones
 Did they change things
 Had there been two murders
 fifty-odd years apart
 one to protect the other
 If so
 then Mackie wasn’t their man
 they’ve been through the records
 he hadn’t left Ireland until the nineties
His mind drifts back to his dream life
 Were there kids sleeping upstairs
 In new pyjamas
 A boy and a girl
 two years apart
 Good sleepers
 But no
 none of that
 just a fireplace in a bar that wasn’t doing enough business
 in a restaurant that he had no one to take to
 Then a walk home
 stop at the all-night shop for a Dairy Milk
 A proper big one
 Then the key fob
 the apartment block
 the three flights up
 the flat that the cleaner kept clean
 that no one ever cooked in
 the spare room that was never used
 If he opened his window he could hear the sea
 but couldn’t see it
 Didn’t that just sum it up
There was a life that Chris hadn’t been able to take in his grasp
 Families
 driveways
 trampolines
 friends round for dinner
 all the stuff you’d see on adverts
 Was this for ever now
 The lonely flat with the neutral walls and the Sky Sports
 Maybe there was a way out
 but Chris couldn’t immediately spot it
 Treading water
 getting fatter
 laughing less
 Chris was out of rocket fuel
 It was lucky that Chris loved his job
 Was good at his job
 Chris always found it easy to get up in the morning
 He just found it hard to go to sleep at night
Leave Mackie be for a minute and focus on Tony Curran’s murder
 Jason Ritchie had rung him earlier
 Told his tale
 Explained away the calls and the car
 If he was lying
 then he’d done a good job of it
 But then he would
 wouldn’t he
Bobby Tanner was still proving elusive
 After Amsterdam
 there was no more Bobby Tanner on any official record
 But he’d be somewhere
 Maybe Brussels
 living under some name or other
 plenty of gangs could use him out there
 He’d be doing what he’d always done
 Smuggling
 fighting
 making himself useful
 Not a big enough fish for anyone to worry about
 Burned often enough to be careful
 They’d catch him coming out of some expat gym one day
 put their hand on his shoulder and fly him back for a few questions
Though
 of course
 there was a good chance that Bobby Tanner was dead too
 Steroids
 pub fight
 fell off a ferry
 so many ways to go and the only way to identify him a false passport
 But Chris thinks Bobby is still out there somewhere
 and if he’s still out there somewhere
 then who’s to say he hadn’t just paid a visit to Tony Curran for some long-forgotten reason
 Something to do with his brother drowning with that boat full of drugs
 Who knew
And then the new name
 Turkish Gianni
 Chris had found plenty on record for him
 Gianni Gunduz was his real name
 Fled the country in the early 2000s after a tip-off he’d murdered the cabbie in the Black Bridge shooting
 Everything kept coming back to that one night
 In this very bar
Had Gianni come back to town
Chris finishes his whisky and looks at the tiles once again
 Beautiful really
He should probably go home
79
Joyce
Just two quick things this morning
 as I find myself in a hurry
Firstly
 Timbuktu is in Mali
 I bumped into Ibrahim on my way back from the post box and I asked him
 I also saw Bernard walking
 slowly
 up the hill
 It’s every day now
 but never mind
And
 as I say
 Mali
 So now you know
Secondly
 Elizabeth rang at 9
17 and we’re off to Folkestone
 From the looks of it it’s two changes
 one at St Leonards and one at Ashford International
 so we’re setting off nice and early
 I haven’t been to Ashford International
 but I doubt a station would have ‘International’ in its name and not have an M&S
 Maybe even an Oliver Bonas
 Fingers crossed
I promise I will report back later
80
In many ways
 his neighbours owed Peter Ward a debt of thanks and
 to be fair
 most of them knew it
Pearson Street had always been a little down at heel
 A newsagent with no papers
 a mini-mart
 with a mountain of cheap alcohol behind the counter
 a travel agent with fading posters of the sun
 two bookies
 a pub on its last legs
 a party accessories shop
 a nail bar and a boarded-up café
And then The Flower Mill had moved in
 Peter Ward’s shop
 bursting with colour
 a little rainbow explosion on this grey street
And what flowers! Peter Ward knew his stuff and when you know your stuff in a small town
 word soon gets around
 People would start making detours from the town centre
 And they would tell their friends
 who would tell their friends and
 before you know it
 someone down from London has spotted the boarded-up café and bought the lease and now there were two reasons to visit Pearson Street
 Then a bride ordering flowers from Peter and enjoying a latte in the café
 sees this little street is on the up and wonders if it might be the place to open a small hardware store
 So now The Tool Chest sits next to The Flower Mill
 opposite Casa Café
 The travel agent suddenly has people walking past
 feels the need to change those posters and those people start walking in
 Under-thirties mainly
 who have no idea what a travel agent might be
 The Londoner with the café buys the pub and starts doing food
 Terry at the newsagent starts ordering in more papers
 more milk
 more everything
 The nail bar paints more nails
 the party shop sells more balloons
 the mini-mart starts stocking gin alongside the vodka
 John from the butcher’s counter at Asda takes the leap and opens a store of his own
 taking his customers with him
 A local art group hires out a vacant storefront and takes it in turns to buy pieces of each other’s art
All thanks to Peter Ward’s orchids and sweet peas and Transvaal daisies
Pearson Street is just what you want a shopping street to be
 Busy
 friendly
 local and happy
 Joyce thinks it’s so perfect
 that it’s surely only six months away from having a Costa and losing what it now has
 Which would be sad
 but Joyce has to admit that she likes a Costa
 so must shoulder some of the blame
Joyce and Elizabeth are sitting in Casa Café
 Peter Ward has just bought them both a cappuccino
 Becky from The Tool Chest will keep an eye out for customers while he takes half an hour off
 It’s that sort of street
Peter Ward is greying and smiling and has the easy air of a man who has made a series of good decisions in life
 A Folkestone florist
 whom karma has rewarded for a lifetime of kindness and calmness
 a man whose good deeds have delivered him the prize of happiness
This impression is misleading
 As the scar under his right eye and the bulge of the biceps will tell you
 Peter Ward is Bobby Tanner
 Or perhaps Peter Ward has left Bobby Tanner behind
 That is what they have come to find out
 Is the fighter still there
 The killer perhaps
 Has he recently made the short trip along the coast to Fairhaven and bludgeoned to death his former boss
 Elizabeth lays the photograph on the table between them and Peter Ward picks it up
 smiling
‘The Black Bridge
’ says Peter
 ‘We had a few nights in there
 Where’d you get this from
’
‘A number of places
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Well
 two places
 in fact
 One was sent to Jason Ritchie and one was found by the corpse of Tony Curran
’
‘I read about Tony
’ nods Peter Ward
 ‘That was about time
’
‘You’ve never seen this photograph before
’ asks Elizabeth
Peter looks again
 then says
 ‘Never have
’
‘You weren’t sent one
’ asks Joyce
 and sips her cappuccino
Peter shakes his head
‘Well
 that’s either good news for you
 or it’s good news for us
’ says Elizabeth
Peter Ward raises an inquiring eyebrow
‘Well
 it’s either good news for you
 in that Tony Curran’s killer has no idea where you are
 Or it’s good news for us
 in that you killed Tony Curran yourself and we haven’t wasted a trip to Folkestone
’
Peter Ward gives a half smile and looks at the photo again
‘Not that the trip would really be wasted
’ says Joyce
 ‘We’re having a very nice day
’
‘The police have the idea that Jason killed Tony Curran
’ starts Elizabeth
 ‘And perhaps he did
 But
 for reasons of our own
 we would prefer that he didn’t
 Would you have a view on that
 Bobby
’
Peter Ward holds up a hand
‘Peter around here
 please
’
‘Would you have a view on that
 Peter
’ asks Elizabeth
‘I don’t see it
’ says Peter Ward
 ‘Jason went nowhere near that side of things
 He looks mean
 but he’s a teddy bear
’
Joyce looks up from her notes for a moment
 ‘A teddy bear who funded a major drugs ring
’
Peter acknowledges this with a nod
Elizabeth puts the photo back down on the table
 ‘So
 if not Jason
 then perhaps you
 Or perhaps Turkish Gianni
’
‘Turkish Gianni
’ says Peter
‘He took the photo
’
Peter Ward thinks for a while
 ‘Did he now
 I don’t remember
 but that would make sense
 I’m guessing you know the story
 The boy Tony shot in the Black Bridge
 Gianni shooting the taxi driver who got rid of the body
’
‘We know that story
 yes
’ confirms Elizabeth
 ‘Then Gianni disappears back to Cyprus
’
‘Well
 it wasn’t quite that simple
’ says Peter Ward
‘I’m all ears
’ says Elizabeth
‘Someone grassed Gianni up to the cops
 They raided his flat
 but he’d gone already
’
‘And who grassed him up
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Who knows
 Not me
’
‘No one likes a grass
’ says Joyce
‘It doesn’t matter who
’ says Peter Ward
 ‘What matters is that when Gianni legged it
 he took a hundred grand of Tony’s cash with him
’
‘Is that so
’
‘Money he had lying around his flat
 Tony’s money
 All disappeared
 Tony went mental
 A hundred grand was a lot of money to Tony in those days
’
‘Did he try and find Gianni
’ asks Elizabeth
‘You bet
 Went off to Cyprus a couple of times
 Didn’t find a thing
’
‘Not easy when it’s not your natural territory
’ says Elizabeth
‘So I’m guessing you haven’t found Gianni either
’ asks Peter Ward
Elizabeth shakes her head
‘How did you find me
 by the way
’ he goes on
 ‘If you don’t mind me asking
 I don’t really want to be found by anyone if Gianni’s back in town
 leaving photos of me next to bodies
’
Elizabeth takes a sip of her coffee
 ‘Woodvale Cemetery
 where they buried your brother Troy
’
Peter Ward nods
‘I got access to the CCTV
 thanks to a mortician whose uncle I once saved on a train
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘That’s where I found you
’
Peter Ward looks at Elizabeth
‘Elizabeth
 I’ve been there twice in a year
 There’s no way you found me from the CCTV
 That’d be a needle in a haystack
’
‘You went there twice
 yes
’ agrees Elizabeth
 ‘But on what days
’
Peter Ward sits back
 folds his arms
 then nods and smiles
 He sees it now
‘Twelfth of March and seventeenth of September
’ continues Elizabeth
 ‘Troy’s birthday and the anniversary of his death
 I was hoping to see the same car both times
 jot down a number plate
 get the friend of a friend to run it through a computer somewhere
 But on March the twelfth I saw a white van from a Folkestone flower shop
 which I thought unusual at a cemetery in Brighton
 Not impossible
 but noteworthy
 And I thought it very
 very unusual to see the same van on September the seventeenth
 I found that very noteworthy indeed
 You see
’
‘I do see
’ nods Peter Ward
 ‘And no need for a number plate
’
‘Because you had your name
 your address and your telephone number signwritten on the side
’ says Elizabeth
Peter can’t help but give Elizabeth a quiet round of applause and she responds with a slight bow
‘That’s very good
 Elizabeth
’ says Joyce
 ‘She’s very good
 Peter
’
‘I see that
’ says Peter
 ‘So no one else knows where I am
 No one else can find me
’
‘Not unless I tell them where you are
’ says Elizabeth
Peter Ward leans forward
 ‘And is that something you’d be likely to do
’
Elizabeth leans forward too
 ‘Not if you come and see us tomorrow
 sit down with Jason and the police and tell them what you just told us
’
81
‘Would you like a walnut
’ asks Ibrahim
Bernard Cottle looks at him and then down at the open bag of walnuts he is being offered
‘No thank you
’
Ibrahim withdraws the bag
 ‘Very low carb
 walnuts
 In moderation
 nuts are very healthy
 But not cashews
 cashews are an exception
 Am I disturbing you
 Bernard
’
‘No
 no
’ says Bernard
‘Just enjoying the view
’ asks Ibrahim
 He can sense that Bernard feels uncomfortable sharing his bench
‘Just taking the weight off
’ says Bernard
‘What a place to be buried
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Wouldn’t you think
’
‘If one has to be buried
’ says Bernard
‘Sadly
 it comes to the best of us
 doesn’t it
 However many walnuts we might eat
’
‘I mean no offence by this
 but I’m very happy to sit in silence
’ says Bernard
‘That’s not unreasonable
’ says Ibrahim
 nodding
 He eats a piece of walnut
The two men sit
 taking in the view
 Ibrahim turns
 and sees Ron walking up the path
 trying to hide his limp
 He has a stick
 but he won’t use it
‘Well
 this is nice
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Here comes Ron
’
Bernard looks
 there is the slightest pursing of the lips
Ron reaches the bench
 He sits the other side of Bernard
‘Afternoon
 gents
’ says Ron
‘Good afternoon
 Ron
’ says Ibrahim
‘So
 Bernard
 old son
’ says Ron
 ‘You keeping guard
’
Bernard looks at Ron
 ‘Keeping guard
’
‘Of the graveyard
 Sitting here like a gnome
 “none shall pass”
 all that
 What’s up
’
‘Bernard wants to be left in silence
 Ron
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘That’s what he tells me
’
‘Fat chance of that with me around
’ says Ron
 ‘So come on
 mate
 What are you hiding up here
’
‘Hiding
’ asks Bernard
‘I don’t buy all this grief stuff
 son
 We all miss our wives
 with the greatest respect
 Something else is going on here
’
‘I think grief affects people in different ways
 Ron
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Bernard’s behaviour is not unusual
’
‘I don’t know
 Ib
’ says Ron
 shaking his head and looking out over the hills
 ‘Geezer gets killed the other day
 when all he wanted to do was dig up the graveyard
 Bernard sits here by that same graveyard all day
 every day
 That changes things for me
’
‘Is that what’s happening here
’ asks Bernard
 voice calm and level
 refusing to look at Ron
 ‘You’re talking to me about the murder
’
‘That’s what’s happening
 Bernard
 yeah
’ says Ron
 ‘Someone down there injected the guy and killed him
 We all had our hands on him
 remember
 Any one of us could have done it
’
‘We simply need to eliminate some people from our inquiries
’ says Ibrahim
‘Maybe you had a good reason
’ says Ron
‘Is there ever a good reason to murder someone
 Ron
’ asks Bernard
Ron shrugs
 ‘Maybe you’ve got something hidden up there in the graveyard
 You a diabetic
 Good with a needle
’
‘We all are
 Ron
’ says Bernard
‘Where were you in the seventies
 mate
 Were you local
’
‘That’s a peculiar question
 Ron
’ says Bernard
 ‘If you don’t mind me saying
’
‘All the same
 were you
’ says Ron
‘We’re just exploring avenues
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘We’re asking everyone
’
Bernard turns to Ibrahim
 ‘Is this the game
 Good cop
 nasty cop
’
Ibrahim considers this
 ‘Well
 yes
 that is the idea
 Psychologically
 it is often very effective
 I have a book you could read if you are interested
’
Bernard lets out a long breath and turns to Ron
 ‘Ron
 you met my wife
 You met Asima
’
Ron nods
‘And you were nothing but kind to her
 She liked you
’
‘Well
 I liked her
 Bernard
 You had a good one there
’
‘Everyone liked her
 Ron
’ says Bernard
 ‘And yet you still ask me why I sit here
 It’s nothing to do with the graveyard and it’s nothing to do with needles
 Or where I lived fifty years ago
 I’m just an old man who misses his wife
 So spare me
’
Bernard stands
‘Gentlemen
 you have spoiled my morning
 Shame on you both
’
Ibrahim looks up at Bernard
 ‘Bernard
 I don’t believe you
 I’m afraid
 I want to
 but I don’t
 You have a story you are desperate to tell
 So
 any time you want to talk
 you know where to find me
’
Bernard smiles and shakes his head
 ‘Talk
 To you
’
Ibrahim nods
 ‘Yes
 talk to me
 Bernard
 Or to Ron
 Whatever has happened
 the worst thing you could do is to stay silent
’
Bernard tucks his paper under his arm
 ‘With respect
 Ibrahim
 Ron
 you have no idea what the worst thing I could do is
’
And with that
 Bernard starts a slow walk down the hill
82
Joyce
Well
 that was jolly good fun
 For starters
 I had never been to Folkestone
Peter Ward is Bobby Tanner’s name now
 but we are sworn to secrecy
 He owns a florist
I suppose I have two things to write about then
 Why was Peter Ward a florist
 And
 florist or not
 who did he think killed Tony Curran
I might write about Bernard too
 but I will leave that to the end
 because I want to think about it while I write the rest
Peter Ward – I will call him Peter – left Fairhaven shortly after his brother died
 for reasons you can imagine
 He got himself a new passport
 It’s easily done if you listen to Elizabeth and Peter
 but I wouldn’t know how to go about it
 would you
 He ended up in Amsterdam
 doing odd jobs
 Not odd jobs as we would think about them
 like clearing your gutters or painting a fence
 but taking cocaine across the Channel on ferries
 Or
 I suppose
 threatening people
 You could see that in him
 underneath everything
He fell in with a gang from Liverpool
 He wouldn’t tell us the name
 as if I would have any sway if he had
 Their ruse was to smuggle drugs in the backs of those big flower lorries you see coming over from Holland and Belgium
 That was their ‘angle’
At first
 Peter would do the loading
 A driver would be paid such and such to stop his lorry in a lay-by in Belgium
 and Peter and a few cronies would hop in the back and stash what they could
 where they could
 Over the lorry would go
 another stop in Kent and Bob’s your uncle
 These lorries were back and forth all the time
 It’s a daily schedule
 isn’t it
 Has to be
 because of fresh flowers
 So it was perfect
They just had the odd driver here and there and that’s how it worked at first
 Until the penny dropped and they bought one of the nurseries
 The business ran as usual
 but Peter was on hand to ‘inspect’ every shipment as it went out
 and to add that little special something to each one
 So now they had three lorries a day travelling through Zeebrugge and they could do what they liked with them
 Clever
 really
Peter would spend all his time at the nursery
 and the young lad who ran it was paid to turn a blind eye
 They’d play cards and chat and whatever else you do all day in Belgium
(Off-subject for a minute
 but there was a notice pinned up the other day about a trip to Bruges and I thought of signing up
 Joanna went a few years ago and her verdict was
 ‘It’s too twee
 Mum
 but you would love it
’ so I might take the plunge
 Would Elizabeth like it
)
That’s by the by
 because here’s what happened next
 There was an error
 no one knows how or why
 or at least Peter doesn’t
 but the upshot was that a small florist’s shop in Gillingham accidentally took delivery of two kilograms of cocaine alongside their begonias and promptly reported it to the police
The police
 who are no fools at times
 didn’t rush straight in and arrest the driver
 they followed him instead and saw where he headed and what was what
 There was a whole team on it eventually
 and one by one they worked out who was doing what and arrested everyone they could
The way Peter told it
 he and the young lad running the nursery had seen the police coming a mile off (Belgium is as flat as Holland
 says Peter) and they hid in a field of sunflowers for six hours as the police stripped the place bare
 In Amsterdam
 one of the Liverpudlians was killed by a Serbian shortly afterwards and that was that
You can see where it’s going
 I’m sure
 Peter had never really risen through the ranks
 he wasn’t really the type
 but he’d made a bit of money and he had learned an awful lot about flowers
 And he saw them at their most beautiful
 of course
 He described the colours and so on and got quite lyrical
 Elizabeth had to hurry him along eventually
So
 now
 every day
 one of those big lorries pulls up in Pearson Street and Peter gets in the back
 like he always used to
 but this time he just unloads his flowers and carries them into his shop
 And the lorry continues on its rounds and heads back to Belgium
 to the nursery run by the young lad he’d played cards with and hidden in a sunflower field with
So that’s a nice story
 I bet the Liverpudlians and the Serbians are still shooting each other left
 right and centre in Amsterdam
 but Peter has his beautiful shop
 in that lovely street
 where everybody knows his name
 Or doesn’t know his name
 but you take my point
 And the benefit of going straight was that no one has ever come looking for him
 no one has ever arrested him and taken a closer look at that passport
 so Peter Ward had left his past behind and found some peace
 which is not easy to do
Just to satisfy Elizabeth’s curiosity
 Peter took her to The Flower Mill and showed her the CCTV from the day Tony Curran was murdered
 There he was
 Peter
 I mean
 plain to see
 behind the till
 Which I think rules him out
 He is sure that Turkish Gianni is our man
 Tony had betrayed him to the police and Gianni had stolen from Tony in turn
 That would do it
 I suppose
Elizabeth and I talked about it on the train
 And we had half an hour at Ashford International
 where
 believe it or not
 there are no shops
 Perhaps there are shops beyond passport control
 There must be
 surely
So that’s Bobby Tanner
 Time for bed
 Joyce
 I wonder what Ron and Ibrahim were up to today
I know I was going to say something about Bernard
 but it hasn’t really formulated
 so I won’t
I bought Bernard some freesias from Peter Ward’s shop
 I wanted to buy something but I couldn’t think who to buy them for and I thought perhaps Bernard would like them
 Do women give men flowers
 Not where I’m from
 but perhaps that’s not where I am any more
 So they’re in the sink
 and I will take them over tomorrow morning
Bernard would like Bruges
 Don’t you think
83
The path is uneven
 but by shining a torch at the ground he is able to make his way up to the allotments without drawing attention to himself
 It is late
 and everyone will be asleep
 but why take a risk
 He reaches the shed
 There is a padlock
 but it’s a cheap one and his wife’s hatpin soon springs it open
The shed is shared by all the residents who have an allotment at Coopers Chase
 A select band
 There are a couple of folding chairs for nice weather and there’s a kettle for colder weather
 There are bags of fertilizer and mulch along one wall
 These are bought from the kitty and Carlito carries them in whenever the minibus comes back from the Garden Centre
 Pinned above the fertilizer are the rules of the Coopers Chase Allotment Users Association
 They are lengthy and they are enforced with vigour
 It is cold
 even on a summer’s night
 The torch continues its circuit
 There are no windows
 which makes it easier
The spade rests against the back wall inside the shed
One look tells him all he needs to know
 All he already knew
 if he was honest
 as he walked up the path
 But what to do
 You have to try
He lifts it by the handle
 but is quickly beaten by its weight
 When did he get so weak
 What happened to his body
 It was never much to write home about
 but to think he could now barely lift a spade
 Digging was out of the question
So what now
 Who could help
 Who would understand
 It was hopeless
Bernard Cottle sits in a folding chair and weeps for what he has done
84
Chris and Donna are sitting in the Jigsaw Room
 with mugs of tea
 Opposite them are Jason Ritchie and Bobby Tanner
 Bobby Tanner
 whom detectives across eight forces had failed to locate
 Elizabeth has repeatedly refused to say where or how she found him
Elizabeth and Joyce have both seen evidence that Bobby was busy elsewhere when Tony Curran was murdered
 Chris had wondered if he might see that evidence and Elizabeth had told him he certainly could
 the moment he produced a warrant
 Bobby’s deal was that he would tell them everything he knew and then slip back into the crowd
 never to be seen again
‘A hundred grand
 bit more than that
’ says Bobby Tanner
 ‘Gianni had it at his flat
 used to keep it safe for Tony
’
‘Did he have a nice flat
’ asks Joyce
‘Uhh
 one of the big ones on the front
’ says Bobby
‘Oh yes
 with the picture windows
’ says Joyce
 ‘Lovely
’
‘And Tony went out to Cyprus looking for him
’ asks Chris
‘A couple of times
 yeah
 Never found a thing
 Nothing was the same after that
 Jason
 you drifted off
 didn’t you
 Started doing telly and all that
’
Jason nods
 ‘It wasn’t for me any more
 Bobby
’
Bobby nods
 ‘I left town a couple of months after
 when my brother died
 Nothing left for me here then
’
‘But someone would have seen Gianni
 surely
’ asks Donna
 ‘If he’d come back to town recently
 Someone would have seen him
 someone would be talking
’
Bobby thinks about this
 ‘Not too many faces left from those days
’
‘Hard to know who Gianni would turn to if he needed a place to stay
’ says Jason
Bobby looks at Jason
 ‘Unless
 Jase …
’
Jason looks back at Bobby
 thinks for a moment
 then nods
 ‘Of course
 of course
 Unless …’
Jason starts composing a text
‘Are you going to share this with the group
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Just someone me and Bobby need to talk to
’ says Jason
 ‘Someone who’d know for sure
 Leave it with us
 It’s not fair if you get to solve everything
 Elizabeth
’
‘Perhaps you could share it with the police
’ suggests Donna
‘Oh come on
’ says Bobby
 laughing
‘Worth a try
’ says Donna
Jason’s phone pings
 He looks down
 then turns to Bobby
‘He can meet us at two
 That OK for you
’
Bobby nods and Jason starts another message
‘Only one place for it
 eh
’
85
Lunch at Le Pont Noir
 Just like old times and yet
 of course
 not like them at all
‘Astronaut
’ guesses Jason Ritchie
Bobby Tanner smiles
 and shakes his head
‘Jockey
’ guesses Jason
Bobby Tanner shakes his head again
 ‘I ain’t gonna tell you
 even if you guess
’
Fair enough
 fair enough
‘You happy though
 Bobby
’ asks Jason
Bobby nods his head
‘Good lad
’ says Jason
 ‘You deserve it
’
‘We both do
’ agrees Bobby Tanner
 ‘One way or another
’
‘Well
 we do and we don’t
’ says Jason
Bobby Tanner nods
 Maybe so
They are on desserts
 still waiting for their guest
 and a bottle of Le Pont Noir’s finest Malbec has been dispatched
‘I mean
 it must have been Gianni
 right
’ asks Bobby
 ‘I’ve always thought he was dead somewhere
’
‘I’ve always thought that you were dead somewhere
’ says Jason
 ‘I’m glad you’re not though
’
‘Thanks
 Jase
’ says Bobby
Jason looks at his watch
 ‘We’ll know for sure soon enough
’
‘You reckon he’ll know
’ asks Bobby
‘If Gianni’s been over
 then he’ll know
 That’s where he’d have stayed
’
‘I can’t do lunchtime drinking any more
 can you
’ asks Bobby
‘We’re old men now
 Bob
’ agrees Jason
 ‘Time for another bottle though
’
They agree that they do have time for another bottle
 And then in walks Steve Georgiou
86
Donna has spent the evening looking through aeroplane passenger lists to and from Cyprus for the last two weeks
 As if Gianni Gunduz would be using his own name these days
 But you never knew
Fun though the passenger lists had been
 however
 Donna is now back on Instagram
Toyota was history already
 but Carl wouldn’t wait around
 Who was he seeing now
 Donna was nothing if not a natural detective
 Was he seeing that woman from his work
 Poppy
 Poppy
 whose photo he’d liked on Facebook
 Not just liked
 but replied to with a wink emoji
 Poppy
 who seemed incapable of having her photo taken without being shot from the left and pouting
 Yes
 she was obvious enough for Carl
 Donna had run her name through the Home Office computer on the off-chance
 but nothing
Donna knows it is time for bed
 but she is still thinking about Penny Gray
After the Thursday Murder Club meeting
 Elizabeth had told her she wanted her to meet someone and had led her into Willows
 the nursing home attached to Coopers Chase
They had walked down quiet beige corridors
 with dim strip lighting and seaside watercolours lining the walls
 It all carried an appalling weight
 and the hopeful sprigs of flowers on cheap MDF side tables were powerless against it
 Who brought the flowers in every day
 That was a losing battle
 but what was the alternative
 Donna had gulped for air at one point
 Willows was a prison from which no escape was possible
 Where release could mean only one thing
They had walked into the room and Elizabeth had said
 ‘Constable De Freitas
 I’d like you to meet Detective Inspector Penny Gray
’
Penny had been lying in bed
 a light sheet covering her to the neck
 a blanket further down
 folded back
 Tubes running from her nose and from her wrists
 Donna had once been on a school trip to the Lloyd’s Building
 where everything that should be on the inside was on the outside
 She preferred everything tidied away
Donna saluted
 ‘Ma’am
’
‘Take a seat
 Donna
 I thought it would be nice for the two of you to get to know each other
 I do think you’ll get along
’
Elizabeth had taken Donna through Penny’s career
 Smart
 resilient
 opinionated
 thwarted at every turn
 by her gender and by her temperament
 Or rather by the unacceptable combination of them both
‘She’s a wrecking ball
’ Elizabeth had said
 ‘I’m a thin blade
 you understand
 Penny is all brute force
 I don’t know if you could tell that now
’
Donna looked at Penny and fancied that she could
‘It was fashionable in the police back then
’ Elizabeth had gone on
 ‘A bit of blunt force
 Fashionable if you were a man at least
 it never helped Penny
 she never made it higher than Detective Inspector
 Absurd if you knew her
 I’m right
 John
 absurd
 wasn’t it
’
John had looked up and nodded
 ‘A waste
’
‘She was trouble
 Donna
’ said Elizabeth
 ‘And I can think of no finer compliment
 That’s why Penny enjoyed looking over the old cases
 She could finally be in charge
 Could finally be the bull in a china shop
 She didn’t have to be polite and laugh at the jokes and make the tea
’
Donna saw Elizabeth’s hand close around Penny’s
Elizabeth looked at her and nodded
 ‘We fight on though
 do we not
 Penny took it all
 sucked it up
 as they say
 day after day
 without complaint
’
‘She complained a lot
’ This was John
 ‘With respect
 Elizabeth
’
‘Well
 yes
 she had an impressive temper on her when she wanted to
’
‘Very focused
’ John had agreed
As they had left
 generations apart
 but shoulder to shoulder and in perfect step
 Elizabeth had turned to Donna and said
 ‘You will know better than me
 Donna
 but I think perhaps not all the battles have been won
’
‘I think perhaps too
’ Donna had agreed
 They had continued
 in companionable silence
 out through the front doors of Willows
 grateful to be breathing the air of the outside world
Back at home – was this really home now
 – Donna is not fully concentrating on Instagram any more
 The visit to Penny has made her proud and sad
 She would love to have met her
 Really met her
 There are many reasons why Donna would like to be the one to crack these murders
 and she adds making Detective Inspector Penny Gray proud to her list
Gianni for the Tony Curran murder
 Matthew Mackie for Ventham
 Elizabeth had told her to look into another of the residents
 A Bernard Cottle
 She had written the name down
And the bones
 Are they important
What do you say
 Penny Gray
It would be nice to wrap it all up
 A nice tribute to someone who has gone before
 She should get back to those passenger lists
Donna scrolls through some final pictures
 Poppy has just been bungee-jumping for Cancer Research
 Well of course she has
 that was so Poppy
87
Joyce
I don’t often write in the morning
 I know
 But today I am
 I just felt I should
 So here I am
Yesterday was all very interesting
 wasn’t it
 Those boys and all the murders and the drugs and what have you
 I bet they had a lot to talk about when they headed off afterwards
 I wonder who they were meeting
Really
 it was very interesting to someone like me
 Very interesting
 Gianni certainly sounds a likely culprit
 doesn’t he
I wonder if … Oh stop it
 Joyce
 just stop it
 You’re putting it off
 You don’t want to write it
All right then
 So I have had some sad news
 and the sad news is this
I made my ‘All’s Well’ call to Bernard this morning
Lots of people have an ‘All’s Well’ arrangement
 You buddy up with a pal
 ring them at 8 a
m
 let it ring twice and put the phone down
 Then they do the same back
 So you each know the other is OK without it costing you a penny
 And
 of course
 you don’t have to have a conversation
So I rang Bernard this morning
 Two rings
 letting him know I was safe and sound
 hadn’t had a fall or what have you
 But nothing back
 I never worry too much
 sometimes he forgets and I wander round and ring his buzzer and he shuffles to the window in his dressing gown and gives me a guilty thumbs-up
 I always think
 ‘Oh let me in
 you silly old man
 let’s have some breakfast
 I don’t mind the dressing gown
’ but that’s not Bernard
So over I trotted
 Did I know
 I suppose I did
 but I also didn’t
 because it’s too big a thing to know
 But I suppose I did know
 because Marjorie Walters saw me on my way over
 and said she’d waved but I hadn’t seen
 just lost in a world of my own
 which isn’t like me
 So
 yes
 I suppose I knew
I buzzed and looked up at the window
 The curtains were drawn
 Perhaps he was asleep
 Had a touch of flu and stayed in bed
 ‘Man flu’
 someone had said on This Morning the other day
 It had tickled me and I’d told Joanna
 but she said the expression had been around for years and had I really never heard it
 Which put me in my place
I’m stalling
 I know
 Let’s get on to it
I let myself into the block with the spare key fob
 I walked up the flight of stairs and saw an envelope Sellotaped to Bernard’s door
 On the front of it he had written ‘Joyce’
Sorry
 I have to finish there
There was even a smiley face in the ‘O’
 You really never knew with Bernard
88
Joyce opens up the envelope and slips out a handwritten letter
 Maybe three or four pages
 She is grateful that her friends have come to her flat
 She didn’t want to go out there again today
‘So
 I’ll just read it
 Not all of it
 but the bits of interest
 It answers a few questions we had
 I know what some of you had been thinking about him
 Maybe thought he’d
 you know … Ian Ventham
 Anyway
’
‘You take your time
’ says Ron
 and places his hand on Joyce’s for a moment
Joyce begins to read
 with an unfamiliar waver
‘“Dear Joyce
 I am sorry for the nuisance
 Don’t try to come in
 I have bolted the door
 First time I have used that bolt since I moved here
 You will know what I have done
 and I suppose it’s nothing you haven’t seen before a thousand times
 I will be lying on the bed
 all things being well
 and perhaps I will look peaceful
 but perhaps I won’t
 I would rather not take that chance
 so I’ll leave it to the ambulance men to decide if I look in a fit state for you to say goodbye
 That is if you wish to say goodbye
”’
Joyce stops reading for a moment
 Elizabeth
 Ron and Ibrahim are completely silent
 She looks up at them
 ‘They didn’t let me see him in the end
 I’m sure that’s policy
 when you’re not family
 So he got that bit wrong
 didn’t he
 And they were both ambulance women
’
Joyce gives a weak smile and her three friends mirror it
 She continues reading
‘“I have the pills by my side and I have a Laphroaig I had been saving for a rainy day
 I see the lights turning off around me and it will be my turn next
 Next to the bed are the beautiful flowers you bought me
 They are in a milk bottle
 because you know me and vases
 But before I go
 I suppose I should tell you the whole thing
”’
‘The whole thing
’ says Elizabeth
Joyce puts a finger to her lips
 Elizabeth does as she is told and Joyce continues reading Bernard’s final letter
‘“As you know
 Asima” – that’s his wife – “died shortly after we moved to Coopers Chase
 which was a spanner in the works
 I know you don’t talk about Gerry very much
 Joyce
 but I know you understand
 Like someone reached in and took out my heart and my lungs and told me to keep living
 Keep waking up
 keep eating
 keep putting one foot in front of the other
 For what
 I don’t think I ever really found an answer to that
 You know I would often walk up the hill and sit on the bench Asima and I used to sit on when we first moved here
 and you know I felt close to her there
 But I had another reason for climbing that hill
 a reason for which I feel profound shame
 A shame that has become too much for me to bear
”’
Joyce pauses for a moment
 ‘I wonder if I might have some water
’
Ron pours her a glass and hands it to her
 Joyce drinks
 then returns to the letter
‘“You will know that many Hindus have their ashes scattered on the Ganges
 These days
 other rivers will do
 but for a certain generation it’s still the Ganges
 if you have the wherewithal
 This was Asima’s wish many
 many years ago
 certainly a wish that our daughter Sufi had grown up hearing about
 Asima’s funeral is not something I wish to think about or write about
 but two days afterwards Sufi and Majid – that’s the daughter and son-in-law – flew to Varanasi in India and scattered Asima’s ashes on the Ganges
 But Joyce – and here’s where the pills and the whisky come in
 I’m afraid – they weren’t her ashes
”’
She pauses and looks up
‘Well
 Goodness!’ says Ibrahim
 and sits forward as Joyce reads on
‘“I am not a religious man
 Joyce
 as you are aware
 But in her later years
 Asima was not a religious woman either
 She shook off her faith slowly
 like the leaves from a tree
 until nothing remained
 I loved that woman with everything I possess and she loved me
 The thought of her leaving
 being placed in hand luggage
 Joyce
 and then floating away from me
 Well
 that wasn’t something I was able to comprehend two days after saying goodbye
 None of this excuses my actions
 but I hope it might explain them
 I had the ashes at home
 for the first night
 Sufi and Majid weren’t in my spare room
 they had preferred to stay in a hotel
 despite it all
‘“Many years ago Asima and I had been browsing at an old antique shop and she had picked up a tea caddy in the shape of a tiger
 ‘Well
 that’s you
’ I said
 and we both laughed
 I called her Little Tiger and she called me Big Tiger
 you know the drill
 I went back a week later to buy it for her
 as a surprise Christmas present
 but it had already been sold
 Anyway
 that Christmas
 I opened my present from her
 and there it was
 She had obviously gone straight back and bought it for me
 I have kept it ever since
 So
 I took the urn and poured the ashes from the urn into the tiger tea caddy
 then placed the caddy back in the cupboard
 I filled the urn with a mixture of sawdust and bonemeal
 it’s surprisingly convincing
 then sealed it shut again
 And that’s what Sufi took to Varanasi and that’s what she scattered on the Ganges
 Bear in mind I wasn’t thinking straight
 Joyce
 I was paralysed with grief
 I would have done anything to stop my Asima floating away
 I had forgotten
 of course
 that she was Sufi’s Asima too
 The next day
 as soon after dark as I dared
 I took a spade from the allotment shed and walked up the hill
 I cut the turf from underneath the bench
 I dug a hole and I buried the tin
 Even then I knew it could only be temporary
 but I wasn’t ready to let her go
 The turf settled back in
 nobody ever noticed a thing – why would they
 – and every day I would go and sit on the bench
 say hello when people walked by and talk to Asima when they didn’t
 I knew then that it was wrong
 I knew that I had betrayed my daughter and that I could never make amends
 But the pain was so very great
”’
‘Some people love their children more than they love their partner
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘and some people love their partner more than their children
 And no one can ever admit to either thing
’
Joyce nods
 absent-mindedly and begins a new page
‘“The immediate pain goes
 however much you might want it to stay
 and I soon came to understand the enormity of what I had done
 The awful selfishness
 the entitlement
 I started to think of plans and plots
 something to put it right
 Maybe I would dig the tea caddy up
 I would take it on the bus down to Fairhaven
 let some of her go and keep some of her with me
 I could never tell Sufi what I had done
 but at least her mother would be in the waves
 returning to wherever Sufi imagines we return to
 I knew it wasn’t enough
 but it was the best I could do
 Until one morning I climbed the hill to find workmen laying a concrete foundation for the bench
 They had dug down
 not far enough to find the tin
 and filled the hole with cement
 They had the job done in half an hour
 And that was that
 I suppose
 so silly when you look at it
 but I had no easy way of digging the tea caddy back up
 So I would continue to walk up the hill and continue to talk to Asima when no one was listening
 telling her my news
 telling her how much I loved her and telling her I was sorry
 And honestly
 Joyce
 for your eyes only
 I realize that I have run out of whatever it is that we need to carry on
 So that’s me
 I’m afraid
”’
Joyce
 finishes
 stares down at the letter for another moment
 running a finger across the ink
 She looks up at her friends and attempts a smile
 which turns
 in an instant
 to tears
 The tears turn to shaking sobs and Ron leaves his chair
 kneels in front her and takes her in his arms
 The thing Ron is so good at
 Joyce buries her head in Ron’s shoulder and flings her arms around him
 weeping for Gerry and for Bernard and for Asima and for the ladies who went to Jersey Boys and drank G&Ts out of cans all the way home
89
It is too late to be in Fairhaven Police Station
 but Donna and Chris have nowhere else to be
Chris kneels and unblocks the paper jam in the photocopier
 Chris finds it hard to kneel without cramping up these days
 He isn’t sure what that is
 Too much salt
 or not enough salt
 It’s one or the other
‘Fixed it
’ he tells Donna
Donna presses ‘Print’ and makes a series of copies of the reports she’s been sent by the Cypriot Police Service
‘I’ll bind them all together for you
’ says Donna
 ‘It’ll take a while
 but it’ll be easier for you
’
‘Very kind
 Donna
’ says Chris
 ‘But you’re still not coming to Cyprus with me
’
Donna sticks out her tongue
Chris has a very interesting interview lined up
 One that should tell them once and for all where Gianni Gunduz is
Gianni’s name has not appeared on any of the passenger lists that Donna had waded through
 No flight
 no boat
 no train
 either into or out of the UK
 But Chris supposes that Gianni is unlikely to still be using his old name
 Not when the police had been hunting him down for the murder of the young cabbie and Tony Curran had been hunting him down for the £100
000 he had stolen
But no one could simply disappear
 There would be a trace somewhere
Chris shuts down his computer
 He feels sure that Turkish Gianni is their man
 he’s been around long enough to sense when something fits perfectly
 Evidence was another thing
 but hopefully the trip to Nicosia will help him out there
‘Shall we call it a night
’
‘Quick drink
’ says Donna
 ‘Pont Noir
’
‘Six-fifty flight in the morning
’ says Chris
‘Don’t rub it in
’ says Donna
Chris stands and pulls down his office blinds
 Gianni was one thing
 but Ian Ventham
 That was harder
 Was it really connected to a murder from fifty years ago
 Surely not
 How many people could there be
 Chris even had two DIs tracking down nuns in case they could remember anything
 Surely some of them had left at some point
 Lost their calling and gone out into the real world
 What would they be now
 Eighty-odd
 Records were sketchy though
 and he held out little hope
 Or were they all missing something simpler
‘Don’t crack the case while I’m gone please
’
‘I can’t promise anything
’ says Donna
Chris picks up his briefcase
 Time to go home
 Always the worst time
 Chris’s dream life remains just one stone away
 But in his briefcase there is a packet of Salt & Vinegar McCoys
 a Wispa and a Diet Coke
 Diet Coke
 Who did Chris think he was kidding
Sometimes Chris thinks he should join a dating website
 In his mind his perfect date would be a divorced teacher who had a small dog and sang in a choir
 But he’d be happy to be proved wrong
 Just someone kind and funny really
Chris holds the door open for Donna
 then follows her out
What kind of woman would want Chris
 Did women really mind a bit of extra timber these days
 Well
 yes
 he was sure they did
 but even so
 He was just about to solve a murder
 and surely
 somewhere in the whole of Kent
 there was someone who might find that attractive
90
Joyce
Oh
 I can’t sleep
 It’s Bernard
 Bernard
 Bernard
 of course
 I’m already wondering about the funeral
 Will it be here
 I do hope so
 I know I hadn’t known him long
 but I’d hate to think of him in Vancouver
So I’m back here at two in the morning
 to give you some news
 Don’t worry
 no one has died this time
After Ian we had all been wondering what’s to become of us here at Coopers Chase
 Who was going to take it over
 I don’t think anyone was too concerned
 it seems to be profitable enough
 so we knew there would be takers
 But who
You can probably guess who found out
Elizabeth ‘accidentally’ bumped into Gemma Ventham
 Ian Ventham’s unfortunate widow yesterday
 at the new deli they’ve opened in Robertsbridge
 It used to be Claire’s Hairdressers
 until Claire was struck off
 Is ‘struck off’ the correct expression for hairdressers
 Either way
 the local GP’s wife lost the top of an ear and that was that
 They say Claire’s in Brighton now
 and that’s probably for the best
Gemma was with a man
 who Elizabeth described as ‘a tennis-coach type’
 though conceded that these days he might have been ‘a Pilates-instructor type’
 Certainly not a grieving widow
 and I think we all agreed that she’d earned a bit of happiness
 so good for her
She has also
 it seems
 earned an awful lot of money
 This is what Elizabeth got out of her
 I don’t know exactly how
 but I do know that at one point she had pretended to faint
 because she had actually grazed her elbow in the effort
 She always finds a way
 that one
Anyway
 Gemma Ventham has sold Coopers Chase Holdings to a company called Bramley Holdings
 Of course
 we’ve tried to find out as much as we can about Bramley Holdings
 but thus far
 no luck
 We even called in Joanna and Cornelius
 but they’ve turned up a blank
 They promised they would keep looking
 although you can hear that Cornelius’s patience is beginning to wear a bit thin
But here’s something else keeping me awake
 That name
Bramley Holdings
 It is ringing a bell and I can’t work out why
 Elizabeth says they take names off the shelf
 and perhaps she is right
 but an alarm is ringing in my brain and I can’t switch it off
Bramley
 Where have I heard that before
 And I know I’m an old woman
 but don’t say apples
 Something else
 Something important
Anne
 who edits Cut to the Chase
 came to see me today
 People will always come and see you when you lose a friend
 By now we’ve all worked out the right things to say
 We’ve said them often enough
I don’t think she is doing it just to be nice
 but Anne has asked if I will write a column in Cut to the Chase
 She knows I like to write and she knows I have my nose in everything
 so would I write something about the comings and goings at Coopers Chase
 I said yes
 of course
 and we are going to call it ‘Joyce’s Choices’
 which I like
 I had suggested ‘Joyce’s Voices’
 but Anne had thought that might sound a bit mental health
 She wants a picture of me
 so I will go through a few tomorrow and pick out a nice one
We are off to see Gordon Playfair tomorrow as well
 The farmer at the top of the hill
 He’s the only person any of us can think of who was here in the early 1970s and is still here today
 He was nowhere near Ventham when he was murdered
 so I don’t think we can count him as a suspect
 but we’re hoping he might remember something useful from all those years ago
I must try and sleep again
91
‘Quaint
’ repeats Gordon Playfair
 laughing
 ‘This place
 You and I know it’s an old house
 falling apart
 for an old man falling apart
’
‘We’re all falling apart
 Gordon
’ says Elizabeth
The walk to the Playfair farm had taken longer than expected
 because a police cordon has been placed around the Garden of Eternal Rest
 By all accounts
 two police cars and a white van
 popularly believed to be a forensics unit
 had carefully parked at around 10 a
m
 and a number of officers in white body suits had walked up the hill with spades
 Martin Sedge has a top-floor flat in Larkin and is training binoculars on the site
 but no news yet
 ‘Just some digging
’ was his most recent report
‘This house and me have grown old together
 Roof coming off
’ says Gordon
 and rubs the few strands of hair left on his head
 ‘Things creak that didn’t use to creak
 Dodgy plumbing
 We’re two of a kind
’
‘We don’t disturb you too much
 The village
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Never hear a peep
’ says Gordon
 ‘Might as well still be the nuns down there
’
‘You should come and visit us sometime
’ says Joyce
 ‘There’s a restaurant
 there’s a pool
 There’s Zumba
’
‘I used to go down a lot in the old days
 Just for bits and bobs
 have a chat
 They were a lively bunch when they weren’t praying
 Also
 if you ever put a nail through your thumb or your ankle down a rabbit hole
 they’d fix you up
’ says Gordon
Elizabeth nods
 fair enough
 ‘You met Ian Ventham on the morning he was murdered
’
‘Unfortunately
 yes
 Not my choice
’
‘Whose choice
’
‘Karen
 my youngest
 She just wanted me to hear him out
 She wants me to sell
 Why wouldn’t she
’
‘And what was discussed
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Same old nonsense
 Same offer
 same manners
 I’ll put it politely by saying I never took to Ian Ventham
 I can be less polite if you’d like
’
‘You weren’t for turning
’
‘They both tried to talk me round
 Karen could see it wasn’t washing
 but Ventham kept on for a bit longer
 Trying to make me feel guilty about the kids
’
‘But you didn’t budge
’
‘I rarely do
’
‘I’m much the same
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And how did you leave it
’
‘He told me he was going to get my land
 one way or another
’
‘And what did you say to that
’ asks Joyce
‘I said
 “Over my dead body
”’ says Gordon Playfair
‘Well
 quite
’ says Elizabeth
‘Anyway
’ says Gordon Playfair
 ‘I’ve been made another offer
 And I’m taking it
 now Ventham’s out of the picture
’
‘Good for you
’ says Elizabeth
‘Now
 might I ask
 is this just a social call
’ says Gordon Playfair
 ‘Or is there something I can help you with
’
‘Funny you should ask
’ Elizabeth says
 nodding
 ‘We were wondering if you had any memories of this place
 From the seventies
 say
’
‘I certainly have plenty of memories
’ says Gordon Playfair
 ‘Might even have a few photo albums if they’d help
’
‘It wouldn’t do any harm to take a look
’ says Elizabeth
‘I should warn you now
 my photos are mainly of sheep
 What is it you’re looking for
’
92
Joyce
So we told Gordon Playfair about the body
 And we all had a good old chat about who might have buried it there all those years ago
 All those years ago
 when Coopers Chase was a convent and a young Gordon Playfair sat in the very same house
 with his young family
 on this very hill
The offer for his land
 by the way
 It was from our mysterious friends at Bramley Holdings
 That name is still driving me crazy
 But it’ll come
 He was just cutting off his nose to spite his face with Ventham
 refusing to sell simply because he couldn’t stand him
 The moment Ventham was out of the picture
 the sale was on
I asked Gordon what he might do with the money
 and it won’t surprise you to know that most of it will go to the kids
 There’s three
 We know one of them
 of course
 Karen
 who lives in the small cottage in the next field over and was supposed to be teaching us about computers
 until we were so unexpectedly interrupted
Unmarried
 but then so is Joanna
 So am I
 come to think of it
So
 lucky kids
 but Gordon says he has enough left over to buy himself a little somewhere nice and
 you will see where this is going
 we’re going to give him a guided tour of Coopers Chase in a few days and see if anything takes his fancy
 Wouldn’t that be fun
 Gordon is craggy
 rather than conventionally handsome
 but has broad
 farmer’s shoulders
Anyway
 back to the bones
 Gordon understood now why we wanted to hear his memories of the 1970s
 And why we were studying his photo albums so intently
 Just to take a look at any shots he’d taken on those trips down the hill all those years ago
 See if anyone rang a bell
In the end
 it was in the second album we looked through
 It started with wedding photos
 Gordon and Sandra (or Susan
 I had glazed over I’m afraid
 you know other people’s wedding photos)
 then pictures of a baby
 suspiciously shortly afterwards
 That will be their eldest
 Then
 and I’m not making this up
 page after page of pictures of sheep and
 the way Gordon was telling it
 all different
 And then
 just as the wine and the fire and the sheep were making us drowsy
 we reached the final photos in the album
 Six in all
 black and white
 All six photos taken at a Christmas party at the convent
 Probably not a party as such
 but certainly Christmas
It was in the fifth photo
 a group shot
 At first you couldn’t really see it
 We’ve all changed a lot over fifty years
 I’m sure I wouldn’t recognize Elizabeth
 or she me
 But we all looked and we all looked again
 And we all agreed
And so we have our evidence
 and we have a plan
 Well
 Elizabeth has a plan
And
 speaking of photos
 I found a nice one for my column in Cut to the Chase
 It’s an old photo
 which I know is vain
 but you’d still know it’s me
 Gerry is also in it
 but Anne tells me she can crop him out on the computer
 Sorry
 love
93
There is still a confessional stall in the chapel at the heart of Coopers Chase
 It is used as storage for the cleaners now
 Joyce had helped Elizabeth clear it out
 stacking up the boxes of floor polish on the altar
 neatly tucked behind Jesus
 Elizabeth had given the whole place a spruce up
 even polishing the grille
 As a final touch
 she puts a pair of Orla Kiely cushions on the hard wooden seats
Elizabeth had conducted many interviews in her time
 and brought many people to some kind of justice
 If tapes existed of any of these interviews
 they had long since been buried
 erased or burned
 That was Elizabeth’s fervent hope at least
Lawyers
 No
 Procedure
 Certainly not
 Just whatever worked quickest
Nothing physical ever
 that wasn’t Elizabeth’s style
 She knew it happened from time to time
 but it was never effective
 Psychology was key
 Always try the unexpected
 always approach from an angle
 always lean back in your chair
 with all the time in the world
 and wait for them to tell all
 Like the whole process was their idea in the first place
 And for that you always needed an angle
 something unexpected
 Something bespoke
Like inviting a priest to a confession
Elizabeth realized she was very fond of Donna and Chris
 The Thursday Murder Club had got lucky with those two
 Imagine the bores they might have been saddled with
 She knew that even Donna and Chris would have limits
 though
 and that this was way beyond those limits
 But if she could work her magic with Matthew Mackie
 she knew they would forgive her
And if she couldn’t work her magic
 If her magic was just a memory
 She had been wrong about Ian Ventham murdering Tony Curran
 hadn’t she
But Matthew Mackie was different
 Here was a man who had scuffled with Ventham
 A man who didn’t seem to exist
 yet had been in a photo taken in this very chapel
 A man who both was a priest and wasn’t a priest
 A man who had brushed over his footsteps
Until someone had decided to dig up a graveyard
 His graveyard
And a man who was on his way this very moment
 When it would have been easier for him to stay at home
 Was he coming to confess
 Was he coming to find out what she knew
 Or was he coming with a syringe full of fentanyl
Elizabeth has never been afraid of death
 but
 all the same
 in this moment
 she thinks of Stephen
It is cold in the ageless dark of the chapel and Elizabeth shivers
 She buttons her cardigan
 then looks at her watch
 She would soon find out
 one way or another
94
Chris Hudson is in a small cell
 opposite a large man
 The small cell is an interview room in the Central Prison of Nicosia and the large man is Costas Gunduz
 The father of Gianni Gunduz
Chris is in a concrete seat
 bolted to the floor
 The back is ramrod straight
 It would be the most uncomfortable chair that Chris had ever sat in
 had he not just made the flight to Cyprus on Ryanair
Chris’s trips abroad for work have been few and far between
 Many years ago
 he had gone to Spain to escort home Billy Gill
 a seventy-year-old antiques dealer from Hove who had run a counterfeit pound-coin operation from a garage close to the seafront
 It was a lovely little business
 running pretty much undetectably for many years
 until
 with the advent of the two-pound coin
 Billy had got greedy
 His coins had looked terrific
 but the middles kept falling out
 and after a lengthy stakeout of a Portslade launderette
 Billy’s mint was tracked down and Billy had fled for the sun
 pockets jangling as he went
Chris’s memory of that trip was a cramped charter flight from Shoreham airport
 landing somewhere in Spain beginning with A
 being driven for forty-five minutes in searing heat
 the van stopping and a handcuffed Billy Gill being shoved alongside him
 and waiting seven hours for a flight home
 all the while listening to Billy Gill telling him you couldn’t get Marmite in Spain
Then a few years later there had been a compulsory IT course on the Isle of Wight
 And
 so far
 that had been that for globetrotting
But Cyprus was a bit more like it
 Too hot
 obviously
 but more like it
 He’d been met at Larnaca airport and driven to the capital by Joe Kyprianou
 the Cypriot detective who now sat next to him
 The prison was nice and cool and
 Chris discovered
 it’s impossible to sweat when sitting on a concrete chair
 From the moment the cell doors closed
 he had been happy
Costas Gunduz was
 Chris guessed
 somewhere in his seventies
 but was a lot less chatty than Billy Gill
‘When was the last time you saw Gianni
’ asks Chris
Costas looks straight at him and shrugs
‘Last week
 Last year
 Does he visit
 Come on
 Costas
’
Costas looks at his nails
 Which
 Chris notes
 are immaculate for a man in prison
‘Here’s the thing
 Mr Gunduz
 We have records showing that your son arrived back in Cyprus
 on 17 May 2000
 Landing at Larnaca airport at around two p
m
 And from that moment to this
 nothing
 Not a trace
 Why might that be
 do you think
’
Costas thinks for a moment
 ‘Why do you want Gianni
 After this time
’
‘I would like to speak to him about an offence in the UK
 To rule him out
’
‘Pretty big offence if you fly here
 No
’
‘A pretty big offence
 Mr Gunduz
 yes
’
Costas Gunduz nods slowly
 ‘And you can’t find Gianni
’
‘I know where he was at two p
m
 on 17 May 2000
 and I’m hazy after that
’ says Chris
 ‘Where would he have gone
 Who would he have seen
’
‘Well
’ says Costas
 sitting up tall in his chair
 ‘he would have come to see me
’
‘And did he
’
Costas leans forward a little and gives Chris a smile
 Then shrugs once again
 ‘Time up
 I think
 Good luck to you
 Enjoy Cyprus
’
Joe Kyprianou leans forward now
 and regards Costas Gunduz
‘Costas and his brother Andreas
 they used to steal motorcycles
 Chris
 here in Nicosia
 and ship them off to Turkey
 Pretty easy
 if you have a guy in each port
 They had a little workshop
 file off the serial number
 change the registration
 that’s right
 Costas
 isn’t it
’
‘A long time ago
’ says Costas
‘Then it was cars every now and again
 But they could go on the same boats
 with the same men turning the same blind eye
 so everything is OK for Costas and Andreas
 The years roll by
 bikes and cars
 cars and bikes
 And the cars mean a bigger workshop
 and a bigger lorry
 and bigger crates
’
‘And bigger money for Costas
’ asks Chris
 looking at Costas
‘Bigger money
 for sure
 So all is calm and everyone is happy
 and Costas and Andreas do very nicely
 thank you so much
 And then 1974 and Turkey invade
 You know the story
’
‘Yes
’ says Chris
 He doesn’t
 but he really wants a meal before his flight and he can bet the story is a long one
 He will look it up on Wikipedia if it becomes important
‘So the Turkish invade
 they take over Northern Cyprus
 Pretty much
 The Greek Cypriots in the north come down south
 the Turkish Cypriots in the south go up north
 And that’s Costas and Andreas
’
‘So Costas moved north
’
Joe Kyprianou laughs
 ‘You moved north
 eh Costas
 Like three streets north
 Nicosia was cut in two
 Turkish in the north of the city
 Greek in the south
 So they just moved north of the Green Line and found themselves in a whole new world
’
Google ‘Green Line’
 thinks Chris
‘And Costas
 you sensed opportunity in this new world
 eh
 Started a new business
’
‘Drugs
’ asks Chris
 ‘Naughty Costas
’
Costas shrugs
‘Drugs
’ confirms Joe Kyprianou
 ‘They paid the right people
 Drugs from Turkey come into Northern Cyprus
 Then from Northern Cyprus on to wherever
 whoever
 Huge business very
 very quickly
 and all protected
 Frontier country
 you know
 Ten years on
 the brothers run everything
 they’re Kings of the North
 Untouchable
 Chris
 the whole family
 They pay charities
 open schools
 the whole match
 Gunduz
 You just say the name in Northern Cyprus and see what you see
’
Chris nods
 he gets it
 ‘When Gianni landed back here in 2000
 he disappeared
 never to be seen again
 There was a warrant
 we had officers fly over
 the Cypriot police searched
 but found nothing
’
Joe nods
 ‘It’s simple
 Chris
 really
 If Gianni has to get out of England quick
 he just calls his dad
 He lands at the airport
 Costas sends people to pick him up
 burn the passport
 new one straight away
 New guy
 new name
 back up to Northern Cyprus
 back to business
 Next day
 back to business
 I guarantee
 Is that what happened
 Costas
’
‘Nothing happened
’ says Costas
‘And the search
’ asks Chris
 ‘Our guys
 Your guys
’
‘No chance
 No chance at all
’ says Joe
 ‘I won’t say bad things
 Chris
 because you know how it is
 But no way they even looked
 Not in the right places
 See if your boys wrote it up
 They won’t have set foot in Northern Cyprus
 In 2000
 you can’t believe the power Costas had
 You owned everything and everyone
 eh
 brother
’
Joe looks at Costas
 Costas nods
‘Still does
 even from prison
 So
 however good a cop you are
 why even try
 Gianni could be here
 could be Turkey
 could be US or back in the UK
 You can see Costas knows where he is
 but he’s never going to help you
’
Costas holds out his hands
‘He could have flown into the UK
’ says Chris
 ‘Under any name
 killed Tony Curran and flown back out
 and we’d be none the wiser
’
Joe nods
 ‘Definitely
 Though if he flew to the UK he’d have had help when he got there
 Any Cypriots there who could help him
 Put him up
 Anyone who might be scared of Costas here
 and what he can still do
’
Chris shrugs
 but tucks this away
Costas has had enough
 and stands
 ‘Are we done
 gentlemen
’
Chris nods
 he is out of ammunition
 He knows a pro when he interviews one
 Chris takes out his card and puts it on the table in front of Costas
‘My card
 if anything comes back to you
’
Costas looks at the card
 then at Chris
 then back at the card and lets out a belly laugh
 He looks over at Joe Kyprianou and says something Chris can’t catch
 Joe Kyprianou laughs too
 Costas looks back at Chris for a final time and shakes his head
 firmly
 but not unkindly
Chris gives Costas a shrug of his own
 He is a pro too
Chris had googled it earlier and there is a Starbucks and a Burger King at Larnaca airport
 You saw fewer and fewer Burger Kings these days
 Time to make tracks
 He stands
‘What did they get you for
 Costas
’ asks Chris
 ‘In the end
’
Costas gives a small smile
 ‘I bought a Harley-Davidson
 from the US
 had it shipped over
 Forgot to pay the duty
’
‘You’re kidding
 And they gave you life
’
Costas Gunduz shakes his head
 ‘Sentenced to two weeks and then I killed a prison guard
’
Chris nods
 ‘Quite a family
’
95
Matthew Mackie had been surprised to get the call from Elizabeth
 Asking if he was available for a confession
 He had been gardening and thinking
 The police interview had upset him
 thrown him off balance
 Life had been so simple a few months ago
 His life wasn’t happy
 exactly
 he hadn’t been happy for many years
 but was he at peace perhaps
 Had he found some contentment
 As much as he was ever going to
 he supposed
He had his house
 his garden
 his pension
 He had nice neighbours who would look in on him
 A young family had recently moved in opposite
 and the kids would play on their bikes on the pavement
 He could hear bells and laughter if he kept the windows open
 He could walk down to the sea in five minutes
 He could sit and watch the gulls and read the paper
 when it wasn’t too windy
 People knew him
 and would smile and ask how he was keeping and
 if he wasn’t too busy
 could they tell him about their nose bleeds
 or their hip
 or their sleepless nights
 It was a life
 it had a rhythm and a routine and it kept the ghosts at bay
 What more could you ask
 really
But now
 Brawls
 police interviews
 non-stop worry
 Would he ever get his peace back
 Would this blow over
 He knew it wouldn’t
 Whatever they say about time healing
 some things in life just break and can never be fixed
 For now
 Matthew Mackie was keeping his windows shut
 There were no bells and there was no laughter
 and he was old enough to know there might never be again
It seemed that every bit of news he had received in the last month had been bad
 So what to make of the phone call
 What was this to be
Did he know the confessional stall at St Michael’s Chapel
 she had asked
 Did he know it
 He would still dream of it now
 the darkness
 the dull echo
 the walls closing in on him
 The place where his life broke in two
 never to be fixed
Should he go back there
 It wasn’t a fair question
 He had never left
 He had known his life would lead him back there one day
 God’s sense of humour
 You had to hand it to him
He had seen Elizabeth
 he was sure
 At the consultation meeting and again on the awful day of the murder
 She stood out
 So what was on Elizabeth’s mind
 What sin could she no longer hide
 And why ask for him
 And why there
 She must have seen him on the day of the murder
 he supposed
 Must have seen the dog collar
 that usually stuck in people’s minds
 It often made people want to tell their secrets
 to spill all
 What had he unlocked in her that made her pick up the phone
 And
 for that matter
 how had she got his number
 He wasn’t listed
 Perhaps it was on the internet
 She must have got it somewhere
And so that was that
 Back to St Michael’s
 Into the confessional
 with Elizabeth
 Back to where it all began and where it all ended
 A macabre coincidence
 If only she knew
Matthew Mackie was already on the platform at Bexhill station when he realized Elizabeth hadn’t actually mentioned which of them would be doing the confessing
He thought about turning straight round
 But
 by that point
 he had already bought a ticket
She couldn’t possibly know
 Could she
96
So that
 supposed Chris
 was that
 Gianni Gunduz had managed to disappear
 the prodigal son returned
 protected by his powerful family
 Now to find out if Gianni had recently taken a flight back to England
 A little trip down memory lane
 But under what name
 And with what face
 Gianni could come and go as he pleased
Chris had got to the airport with plenty of time to spare and was enjoying a triple chocolate muffin from Starbucks
 He shouldn’t
 of course
 just empty calories
 but he could think about that when he’d finished the muffin
 He hears an English voice
‘This seat taken
’
Chris motions that the seat is free
 without looking up
 Until his brain registers that the voice is familiar to him
 But of course
 Of course
 Chris looks up
 and nods
‘Good afternoon
 Ron
’
‘Afternoon
 Chris
’ says Ron
 sitting down
 ‘Four hundred and fifty calories in one muffin
 you know
’
‘Are you following me
 Ron
’ asks Chris
 ‘Seeing what there is to see
’
‘No
 we got here yesterday
 old son
’ says Ron
‘We
’ says Chris
Ibrahim arrives with a tray
 He nods at Chris
 ‘How lovely to bump into you
 Detective Chief Inspector! We heard you were here
 Ron
 I didn’t really know how to ask for just an instant coffee
 so I got us Caramel Frappuccinos
’
‘Thanks Ib
’ says Ron
 and takes his drink
‘I wonder if it’s worth my while asking what you two are doing here
’ asks Chris
 ‘Assuming it is just the two of you
 Perhaps Joyce is stocking up in Duty Free
’
‘Just us boys
’ says Ron
 ‘Little jolly to Cyprus
’
‘Quite bonding
 in fact
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘I have never had many close male friends
 Or close female friends
 Or been to Cyprus
’
‘Elizabeth sent us over with instructions
’ says Ron
 ‘She knew someone who knew someone who knew someone
 so here we are
 Probably finding out the same as you
’
‘A very powerful family
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Very easy for Gianni to go missing
 To change his identity
 No trace of him anywhere
’
‘A ghost
’ says Ron
‘A ghost with a grudge
’ agrees Chris
 He has given up on the muffin
 He has already eaten half
 so what was that
 Two hundred and twenty calories
 If the gate was a good walk from Starbucks
 he would work some of that off
 Then nothing on the plane
‘We heard you’ve been to see Gianni’s dad
’ says Ron
 ‘You get anything
’
‘Who did you hear that from
’ asks Chris
‘Does it matter
’ asks Ron
Chris supposes it doesn’t
 ‘He knows where Gianni is
 But even Elizabeth wouldn’t be able to get it out of him
’
The men nod
‘Joyce
 maybe
’ adds Chris
 and they all nod again
 smiling this time
‘You don’t smile very often
 Detective Chief Inspector
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘If you don’t mind me saying so
 That’s just an observation
’
‘If I can make an observation of my own
’ says Chris
 realizing that Ibrahim is right and not wanting to think about it right here
 right now
 ‘If Elizabeth knows someone who knows someone who knows someone
 then why isn’t she here
 Why send Starsky and Hutch when Cagney and Lacey could have come and done the job
’
‘Starsky and Hutch
 very good
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘I would be Hutch
 more methodical
’
There is a boarding announcement
 and the three men gather their belongings
 Chris sees that Ron has a walking stick with him
‘First time I’ve seen you using a stick
 Ron
’
Ron shrugs
 ‘If you’ve got a stick they let you on the plane first
’
‘So where are Elizabeth and Joyce
’ asks Chris
 ‘Or don’t I want to know
’
‘You don’t want to know
’ says Ibrahim
‘Oh great!’ says Chris
97
Candlelight is flickering in the chapel
 Elizabeth and Matthew Mackie are inches apart
 in the confessional
‘I see no point in dressing it up
 And I don’t want forgiveness
 yours or the Lord’s
 I just want it on record
 I want someone to bear witness
 before I die and it’s all dust
 I know there are rules
 even in the confessional
 so you must do whatever you need to do with this information
 I killed a man
 This was a lifetime ago
 and for what it’s worth
 he attacked me and I defended myself
 But I killed him
’
‘Go on
’
‘I was living in digs in Fairhaven
 I don’t know if you’re the type to judge me
 but I had invited him home
 Stupid
 perhaps
 but you were probably stupid back then too
 That’s where he attacked me
 The details are grisly
 but that’s not an excuse
 I fought back and I killed him
 I was so frightened
 I knew exactly how it looked
 No one had seen what happened
 so who would believe me
 They were different times
 you know that
 you remember that
’
‘I remember
’
‘I wrapped the body in a curtain
 I dragged it to my car
 And that’s where I left it while I thought what to do
 This had all happened very quickly
 that’s what you have to understand
 That morning I had woken like everybody else and now here I was
 It seemed so absurd
’
‘How did you kill him
 Can I ask
’
‘I shot him
 In the leg
 I hadn’t thought he would die
 but he bled and he bled and he bled
 So much blood
 so quickly
 Perhaps if he’d made a noise it would have been different
 But he just whimpered
 In shock
 I suppose
 And I watched him die
 as close as I am to you now
’
Silence in the confessional
 Silence in the chapel
 Elizabeth has locked and bolted the door
 No one is going to come in
 And
 of course
 no one is going to get out
 If that was the way this was going to end
‘Then … well
 then I sat and I wept
 because what else was there to do
 I waited for the hand on my shoulder
 for someone to take me away
 It was so monstrous
 But as I sat there and I sat there and I sat there
 nothing much happened
 No one knocked
 no one screamed
 There was no lightning
 So I made myself a cup of tea
 And the kettle still boiled and the steam rose
 and I still had a body
 wrapped in a curtain
 in the boot of my car
 It was a summer evening
 so I turned on the wireless and I waited until dark
 And then I drove here
’
‘Here
’
‘St Michael’s
 yes
 I worked here for a time
 I don’t know if you knew that
’
‘I didn’t
’
‘So I drove through the gates
 and I switched off my lights as I drove up the hill
 The Sisters would always sleep early
 I kept driving
 past St Michael’s
 past the hospital and up the lane to the Garden of Eternal Rest
 You know it
’
‘I know it
’
‘Of course
 And I took my spade
 and I don’t want these walls to crumble around us
 but I chose a grave
 of one of the Sisters
 It was right at the top
 where the earth was soft
 and I dug
 I dug until I hit the wood of a coffin
 Then I walked back to my car
 I tipped the body out of the boot and out of the curtain
 I hadn’t had to remove any clothes
 because he was naked when he attacked me
 you understand
 And so I dragged the body up the path
 through the headstones
 It was hard going
 I remember that
 At one point I cursed
 and then I apologized for cursing
 I got the body up to the hole and tipped it into the grave
 On top of the coffin
 Then I took my spade again
 I filled in the grave and I said a prayer
 Then I walked back to my car
 I put the spade in the boot and I drove home
 That’s as plain as I can tell it
’
‘I understand
’
‘And the knock at the door never came
 Which
 I suppose
 is why I’m telling you all this now
 Because no one knocked at my door and surely someone should have
 In my dreams they knock every night
 There have to be consequences
 So
 what do you think
 Please
 just be honest with me
’
‘Be honest with you
’ Matthew Mackie lets out a long
 slow
 sigh
 ‘I’ll be honest
 I don’t believe a word of it
 Elizabeth
’
‘Not a word
’ queries Elizabeth
 ‘There was a lot of detail
 Father Mackie
 The date
 the gunshot to the leg
 that very particular grave
 What a peculiar thing for me to make up
’
‘Elizabeth
 you didn’t work here in 1970
’
‘Mmm
 You did
 though
 I’ve seen the pictures
’
‘I did
 yes
 I’ve sat here before
 And I’ve sat where you are too
’
Elizabeth decides to start turning the screw
‘You sound like a man who wants to talk
 Anything I’ve said triggered any memories
 Convinced you I might just know something
’
Matthew Mackie gives a sad laugh
 Elizabeth keeps at him
‘If you don’t mind me saying
 Father Mackie
 you gave quite the little jump when I mentioned the Garden of Eternal Rest
’
‘I do mind you saying that
 Elizabeth
 but I suppose I would like to talk
 I’ve always wanted to
 And since we’re both here
 why don’t you play your real cards and see where that gets you
’
‘You’re sure
’
‘I’m at home here
 Elizabeth
 In God’s house
 Let’s talk awhile
 shall we
 Two old fools
 You just start somewhere and I’ll join in where I can
’
‘Shall we start with Ian Ventham
 Shall we talk awhile about him
’
‘Ian Ventham
’
‘Well
 let’s start there at least
 We can always work backwards
 I might start with a question
 Father Mackie
 if you don’t mind
’
‘Ask away
 And call me Matthew
 please
’
‘Thank you
 I will
 So
 first things first
 Matthew
 Why did you kill Ian Ventham
’
98
Joyce
I have been given express instructions
 and Elizabeth has been gone too long
 I wish Ron and Ibrahim were with me
 I’m writing this down while I wait for Donna to arrive
 which I hope will be very soon
It’s beginning to feel like this isn’t all some jolly lark
 An adventure where everything resolves itself and we all come back for more of the same next week
 Elizabeth said two hours and she has now been gone two hours
 A bit more than two hours
 What had I been thinking when I agreed to this in the first place
 There have been lots of things we had kept from Chris and Donna
 but this is by far the most dangerous
 I am not one of nature’s liars
 I can keep my secrets to myself
 right up until the time someone asks me about them
So I made the call to Donna and I told her where Elizabeth had gone and I told her she hadn’t returned
Donna was very angry
 and I understand that
 I told her I was sorry for lying and she said that Elizabeth had been the liar
 I had simply been a coward
 She then called me something which I wouldn’t want to repeat
 but which
 I have to admit
 was fair comment
I am so keen for people to like me that I chose that moment to say how much I had always liked her eye shadow and to ask her where it was from
 But she had already put the phone down
Donna is on her way
 I know she is very worried and so am I
 I have always thought Elizabeth was indestructible
 I hope I’m not wrong
99
Elizabeth has made this walk many times before
 along the curving path
 through the avenue of trees and up to the Garden of Eternal Rest
 She can feel Matthew Mackie’s hand in the small of her back
 guiding her forward
It is always quiet
 but she can never remember it being this quiet
 Even the birds are silent
 What do they know
 It looks like rain
 The sun is doing what it can to pierce the cloud cover
 but she still shivers
 There had been police crime tape here until a matter of days ago
 A fragment has been left tied to a sapling and flaps its blue and white tail in the wind
They pass Bernard’s bench
 It looks absurdly empty
Bernard would have wanted to know what the two of them were doing
 Elizabeth and the priest
 walking slowly up the hill
 faces set in stone
 Bernard would have looked up from his newspaper
 wished them a good day and kept them in sight for the rest of the walk
 But Bernard has gone
 Like so many before him
 Time’s up
 that’s it
 No return
 An empty bench on a silent hill
They reach the gates and Matthew Mackie pushes them open
 He ushers Elizabeth inside
 hand still at her back
 and she hears the hinges squeal shut behind them
Matthew Mackie does not walk her all the way to the top right-hand corner of the Garden of Eternal Rest
 to where the older graves hold their secrets
 Instead
 he takes his hand from her back
 steps off the path and walks between two rows of newer headstones
 cleaner and whiter
 The route he always takes
 Elizabeth follows him this time and they stop in front of a headstone
 Elizabeth looks at the inscription
Sister Margaret Anne
Margaret Farrell
 1948–1971
Elizabeth takes Matthew Mackie’s hand and interlaces her fingers with his
‘It’s a beautiful place
 Elizabeth
’ he says
Elizabeth looks out
 beyond the wall
 to the rolling fields
 the hills
 the trees
 the birds
 It really is a beautiful place
 The peace is broken by a commotion further down the hill
 the sound of footsteps running
 Elizabeth looks at her watch
‘That’ll be my rescue party
’ she says
 ‘I told them if I wasn’t out in two hours
 they were to break down the door
 Come in shooting
’
‘Two hours
’ asks Mackie
 ‘Were we really two hours
’
Elizabeth nods
 ‘There was a great deal to say
 Matthew
’
He nods too
‘You’ll probably have to go through it again when this lot finally get up the hill
’
Elizabeth can see Chris Hudson now
 fresh off the plane she guessed
 running as best he can
 She gives him a friendly wave and sees the relief on his face
 Both that she is still alive and that he can now stop running

There had been a schism in the Cryptic Crossword Club
 Colin Clemence’s weekly solving challenge had been won by Irene Dougherty for the third week running
 Frank Carpenter had made an accusation of impropriety and the accusation had gained some momentum
 The following day a profane crossword clue had been pinned to Colin Clemence’s door
 and
 the moment he had solved it
 all hell had broken loose
The upshot of all this was that Cryptic Crossword Club had been postponed this week
 to let all parties cool down
 and so the Jigsaw Room was unexpectedly free
 The Thursday Murder Club are in their regular seats and Chris and Donna have brought through a couple of stacking chairs from the lounge
 Matthew Mackie sits in an armchair in the corner
 The focus of attention
‘I was not long over from Ireland
 I’d only left for adventure
 really
 In those days they could send you all sorts of places
 Africa or Peru
 but that’s not for me
 converting and what have you
 So this place came up and I sailed over in 1967
 sight unseen
 It was what you see now
 really
 Very beautiful
 very quiet
 a hundred Sisters
 but quiet enough you wouldn’t know it
 They’d pad about
 There was peace
 here
 in the convent
 but it was also a place of work
 and the hospital was always busy
 So I’d stroll about the place
 I’d give sermons and take confessions
 I’d smile when people were happy and I’d cry with them when they were sad
 and that was my job
 Twenty-five years old
 without a thought in my head and without a bone of wisdom in my body
 But I was a man
 and that seemed to be the only thing that counted
’
‘And you lived here
’ Chris asks the question
 Elizabeth had suggested that Chris and Donna take charge of any questioning
 as she was aware she would probably need a few Brownie points by the time today was done
‘There was a gatehouse back then and I had rooms there
 Nice enough
 certainly nicer than the Sisters’ rooms
 No visitors
 of course
 That was the rule
 at least
’
‘A rule you followed
’ asks Donna
‘At first
 of course
 I was eager to do well
 eager to please
 didn’t want to be sent home
 All of that
’
‘But … things change
’ asks Chris
‘Things change
 yes
 Things do change
 I’d met Maggie very early on
 She would clean the chapel
 There were four of them cleaning
’
‘But only one Maggie
’ says Donna
‘Only one Maggie
’ smiles Matthew Mackie
 ‘You know when you look into someone’s eyes for the first time and the whole world breaks apart
 And you just think
 “Of course
 of course
 this is what I’ve been waiting for all this time”
’ That was Maggie
 all right
 And at first it would be
 “Good morning
 Sister Margaret
” and
 “Good morning
 Father
” and so on
 and she’d get on with her work and I’d get on with mine
 Such as it was
 But I would smile
 and she would smile
 and sooner or later it would be
 “A fine morning
 Sister Margaret
 we’re blessed with this sunshine
” and “You’re right
 Father
 how blessed we are
” And then it would be
 “What’s that you’re using on the floor
 Sister Margaret
” and
 “It’s floor polish
 Father
” This wasn’t immediate
 this would be a few weeks in
’
Ron leans forward to say something
 but Elizabeth shoots him a look and he doesn’t
‘Anyway
 let’s say I had been there a month or so
 when Maggie came in for confession
 There we both were
 And neither of us said so much as a word
 We sat there and we sat there
 our bodies inches apart
 just the wood between them
 I can hear her breathing and I can hear my heart thumping
 It’s trying to jump clean out of my chest
 Don’t ask me how long it was
 I wouldn’t have the first clue
 but eventually I say
 “You’ve probably work to be getting on with
 Sister Margaret
” and she says
 “Thank you
 Father
” and that was that
 That was the whole thing clinched and we both knew it
 We both knew the confession was the sin and it wouldn’t be the last
’
‘Would you like a top-up
’ asks Joyce
 tipping her flask of tea
 Mackie lifts his fingers to say no thank you
‘We would meet in private
 which goes without saying
 I know
 I would see her every morning
 but obviously we couldn’t speak with others around
 So I would take her confession and we would talk
 And on those two wooden seats we fell in love
 Maggie and Matthew
 Matthew and Maggie
 Speaking through a grille
 Can you imagine a love so doomed
’
‘And
 forgive me
 but just for the record
 Maggie is Sister Margaret Anne
’ asks Chris
‘She is
’
‘Nineteen forty-eight to nineteen seventy-one
’
Matthew Mackie nods
 ‘I knew we had to get out
 It would be easy enough
 I’d find a job
 I had all my exams
 Maggie would nurse
 we’d buy a place on the coast
 We both grew up by the sea
’
‘You were going to quit the priesthood
’
‘Of course
 Let me ask you
 Why did you join the police
 DCI Hudson
’
Chris thinks for a moment
 ‘Honestly
 I’d finished my A levels
 my mum told me I had to get a job
 and that night we were watching Juliet Bravo
’
‘Well
 isn’t that just it
’ says Matthew Mackie
 ‘In a different town
 in a different country
 I’d have been a pilot or a greengrocer
 but for no good reason other than circumstance
 I was a priest
 In truth
 I’m not a great believer and never have been
 It was a job
 and a roof
 and a passage away from home
’
‘And Maggie
’ asks Donna
 ‘She was going to quit too
’
‘It was harder for Maggie
 She had the religion
 it was still in her
 But she would have
 I think she would
 one day
 I think she’d be in Bexhill with me now
 green eyes blazing
 But it was hard for her
 Mine was the risk of a young man and hers was the risk of a young woman
 and that was a greater risk in those days
 wasn’t it
’
Joyce reaches over and takes his hand
 ‘What happened to your Maggie
 Matthew
’
‘She would visit me
 At night
 if you get the picture
 In the gatehouse
 It was easy enough to slip away after lights out
 Maggie was no fool
 she would have fitted in with you lot
 no problem
 Tuesdays and Fridays she could see me
 those were the safest
 I would light a candle for her
 in an upstairs room
 If there was no candle
 it meant I’d been called away
 or had guests
 and she knew not to come
 But if I lit the candle
 she would always come
 Sometimes straight away and sometimes I’d be waiting and pacing
 but she would always come
’
Mackie clears his throat and furrows his brow
 Joyce squeezes his hand
‘I haven’t told this story in fifty years
 and now twice in a day
’ He gives a weak smile
 then presses on
 ‘It was a Wednesday
 the seventeenth of March
 and I had lit the candle and I was waiting and pacing
 There was one floorboard in the sitting room that
 when you trod on it
 would give three little squeaks
 And I was back and forth and back and forth and it was “squeak
 squeak
 squeak”
 “squeak
 squeak
 squeak”
 And I would hear little sounds outside and think
 “It’s her
” and stop and listen some more
 but each time
 just silence
 The wait went on too long and I got worried
 Had she been caught sneaking out
 Sister Mary was fierce
 I knew everything would be fine really
 because at that age
 everything always was
 So I went upstairs
 blew out the candle
 came down
 laced up my boots and headed up to the convent
 To see what I could see
’
Matthew Mackie looks to the floor
 An old man telling the story of a young man
 Elizabeth catches Ron’s eye and taps her breast pocket
 Ron nods
 then reaches into the inside pocket of his jacket and pulls out a small hip flask
‘I’m just going to have a little nip of whisky
 I hope you’ll keep me company
 Matthew
’
Without waiting for an answer
 Ron pours whisky into Matthew Mackie’s mug
 Mackie nods his thanks
 eyes still to the floor
‘And what did you see
 Father Mackie
’ asks Donna
‘Well
 the convent was dark
 which was good
 If she’d been caught sneaking out there’d be a light somewhere
 Sister Mary’s office
 maybe
 Or some midnight scrubbing in the chapel
 But the only lights were in the infirmary
 I just wanted to do a little tour
 make sure Maggie was safe and sound
 I could think of a hundred good reasons she hadn’t come to me that night
 but I wanted to ease my mind
 I thought I would pick up some papers from the little office I had
 off the back of the chapel
 You know
 if anyone saw me
 I was just catching up on some work
 I couldn’t sleep
 Maybe have a wander around
 If I could have
 I would have had a peek into the dorms
 just to see her lying there
’
‘This room we’re in
’ says Joyce
 ‘this was one of the dorms
’
Matthew Mackie looks around
 nodding
 His left hand gently pats the arm of his chair and he continues
‘I had the chapel key
 You know that door
 it’s so heavy and the lock was so noisy
 but I opened up as quietly as I could
 then shut it behind me
 The place was pitch black
 but I knew my way around
 of course
 Near the altar I bumped into an old wooden chair that shouldn’t have been there
 and that clattered across the floor making a terrible racket
 I thought I should light one of the lamps
 by the altar
 just to make me feel a little calmer
 a little less like a thief
 I lit the lamp and it was a very dim light
 you wouldn’t have seen it from outside
 I don’t think
 not a bright light at all
 Just a dim glow
 really
 And that’s what I would say about the lamp
’
Matthew Mackie picks up his mug and takes a sip
 He places the mug back down
‘So
 that was the light
 the one that I lit
 And really all you could see was the altar
 just shadows
 but enough to see
 Enough to see
’
Matthew Mackie rubs his mouth with the back of his hand
‘And there was Maggie
 There’s a beam above the altar
 At least there was
 You could hang incense or blessings
 It was structural
 I think
 the beam
 but we used it
 Anyway
 Maggie had looped a length of rope around the beam and hung herself
 And not long before I’d got there
 Perhaps she did it when I was tying my laces
 Or perhaps it was when I blew out the candle
 But she was dead
 I could see that clearly
 That’s why she hadn’t come
’
There is quiet in the Jigsaw Room
 Matthew Mackie takes another sip from his mug
‘Thank you
 Ron
 for this
’
Ron makes a ‘don’t mention it’ gesture with his hands
‘Was there a note
 Father Mackie
’ asks Chris
‘No note
 I raised the alarm – quietly
 of course
 this wasn’t a scene for all to see
 I woke Sister Mary and she told me the story
 really
’
‘The story
’ asks Donna
Matthew Mackie nods to himself and Elizabeth takes the reins for a moment
‘Maggie was pregnant
’
‘Bugger me!’ says Ron
 Matthew looks up
 and continues his tale
‘She’d confided in someone
 another of the young nuns
 I never found out who
 Maggie must have trusted her
 whoever she was
 but that was a mistake
 The nun told Sister Mary and then
 about six
 after prayers
 Sister Mary called Maggie to her room
 Sister Mary didn’t tell me what was said
 but I can guess
 and that was Maggie packed and on her way
 She was to stay one last night and be collected in the morning
 straight back to Ireland
 I’d have lit my candle around seven
 I suppose
 Maggie went back to the dorms
 maybe right here where we’re sitting
 She knew how to slip out
 of course
 so she slipped out
 But that night she didn’t come to me
 She came to the chapel and she slipped a noose around her neck
 And she took her life and the life of our child
’
Matthew Mackie looks up at the six other people in the room
‘And that’s my story
 So
 you see
 it wasn’t fine
 was it now
 And nothing was ever fine again
’
‘So how is she buried up on the hill
’ asks Ron
‘That was the deal I made
’ says Mackie
 ‘I was to leave
 which I did
 not a word to a soul
 Back to Ireland
 They found me a job in Kildare
 at a teaching hospital
 All records destroyed
 new records made
 the Church could do what it wanted back then
 They wanted me out of the way
 no trouble
 no scandal
 Not a soul but me and Sister Mary saw the body hanging
 Whatever story they told in the end
 I’ve no idea
 but it wasn’t the story of a priest and a baby and a suicide
 And in return I asked that they allowed her to be buried in the Garden of Eternal Rest
 She wouldn’t have wanted to go home and St Michael’s was the only other place Maggie knew
’
‘And Sister Mary agreed
’ asks Donna
‘It looked better for her too
 There would have been questions otherwise
 Me leaving suddenly
 Maggie sent away for burial
 people would have strung two and two together
 So we made the deal
 and the next morning the car that was coming to pick up Maggie
 picked me up instead
 We drove through the day to Holyhead
 I went back home
 and that’s where I stayed until I heard that Sister Mary had died
 She’s up there in the graveyard too
 you’ll see the cherubs on her headstone
 The day I heard the news I walked out of my job
 I packed a case and I came back to stay
 As near as I could to Maggie
’
‘And that’s why you did everything you could to stop the bodies being moved
’
‘It was the only thing I could do for her
 To find her some final peace
 You’ve all been up there
 you all understand
 It was all I had
 to say sorry and to say
 “I still love you
” Somewhere so beautiful
 for the only love I ever knew
 and for our baby boy
 Or baby girl
 but it’s a boy I’ve always carried in my heart
 I called him Patrick
 which is silly
 I know
’
‘Without being indelicate
 Father
’ says Chris
 ‘I would say that gives you an extraordinary motive for killing Ian Ventham
’
‘It’s not a day for being delicate
 But I didn’t do it
 Can you imagine Maggie ever forgiving me if I’d killed Mr Ventham
 You didn’t know her
 but she’d a temper on her when she wanted
 Every step
 I did what Maggie would have wanted
 and what would have made Patrick proud
 I fought in all the ways I knew how
 but one day I’ll see Maggie again
 and I’ll meet my little boy
 and I intend to do that with a pure heart
’
101
‘Do you like Pilates
’ asks Ibrahim
‘I couldn’t tell you
’ says Gordon Playfair
 ‘What is it
’
His tour of Coopers Chase finished
 Gordon Playfair is sitting with Ibrahim
 Elizabeth and Joyce
 on Ibrahim’s balcony
 Ibrahim has a brandy
 Elizabeth has a G&T and Gordon has a beer
 Ibrahim has them in the fridge for Ron
 although Ron seems to be drinking wine these days
Chris and Donna have returned to Fairhaven
 Before they left
 Chris had told them a little about Cyprus and about Gianni’s connections
 He was pretty sure they have identified their man
Donna was clearly still angry at them
 but she would get over it
 The sun is setting and the day is winding down
Matthew Mackie has gone home to Bexhill
 and to the two candles he keeps lit at all times
 Joyce has promised to come down and visit him
 She loves Bexhill
‘It is the art of controlled movement
’ says Ibrahim
‘Hmmm
’ says Gordon Playfair
 considering this
 ‘Is there darts
’
‘There is snooker
’ says Ibrahim
Gordon nods
 ‘That’s near enough
’
They look out over Coopers Chase
 In the foreground is Larkin Court
 curtained windows in Elizabeth’s flat
 Beyond that is Ruskin Court
 Willows and the convent
 Then those beautiful hills
 rolling to the horizon
‘I could get used to this
’ says Gordon
 ‘There seems to be a lot of drinking involved
’
‘Always
’ agrees Ibrahim
The phone rings and Ibrahim gets up to answer it
 He talks to Gordon Playfair over his shoulder as he goes
‘I think I’ve made Pilates sound too boring
 It is very good for the core muscles and for flexibility
 At any rate
 it is every Tuesday
’
Gordon watches some of the residents pass by below and sips his beer
 ‘You know
 I’m not kidding
 but I wouldn’t know if any of these women had been here back then
 Who’s to say
 All those nuns
 I wouldn’t know
 you know
 You could have been one of the nuns
 Joyce
’
Joyce laughs
 ‘It feels like I have been for the last couple of years
 Not for the want of trying
’
Elizabeth has been thinking the same as Gordon Playfair
 The nuns
 Perhaps that was the route they would have to go down next
 It was Thursday Murder Club tomorrow
 Maybe that’s where they should start
 She feels the gin beginning to work its magic
 Ibrahim returns from his call
‘That was Ron
 He would like us to join him for a drink
 It seems Jason has gifts for us all
’
102
‘Me and Bobby had a little reunion drink in the Black Bridge
 after we all left here
 In Le Pont Noir
 anyway
’
Jason Ritchie takes a swig from his bottle of beer
 Ron has a beer too
 as he always does if Jason is around
 It is important to be a role model
‘You could tell we sort of trusted each other
 you know
 It felt like we’d both changed for the better over the years
 Bobby wouldn’t let on what he’s up to these days
 but he seemed happy
 so fair play
 I don’t suppose anyone wants to tell me what he does now
’
Jason looks expectantly at Elizabeth and Joyce and they both shake their heads
‘Good
’ says Jason
 ‘No one likes a grass
 But we still couldn’t be sure
 you know
 Couldn’t be certain one of us hadn’t done it
 Couldn’t be sure that it was Gianni
 alive and kicking and back for revenge
 So I made a call
’
‘Ooh
 who to
’ asks Joyce
Jason smiles
 ‘What does no one like
 Joyce
’
Joyce nods her defeat
 ‘A grass
 Jason
’
‘Let’s say I called a friend
 someone we all trusted
 but someone who Gianni would have trusted too
 for different reasons
 And he came down – no choice
 really
 if it’s the two of us ringing – and we asked him straight out
 Has Gianni been over
 You seen him
 Just between us and it never goes further
’
‘And had he
’ asks Elizabeth
‘He had
’ says Jason
 ‘Gianni came over three days before Tony was murdered and left the day he died
 He blamed Tony for grassing him up all those years ago
 so he said
 Who knows with Gianni
’
Joyce nods sagely and Jason continues
‘Maybe he just felt the time was right
 Put the record straight
 Some people have long memories
’
‘And you trust this source
 And Peter trusts him
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Peter
’ asks Jason
‘Sorry
 Bobby
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘That’s my age showing
 You and Bobby both trust him
’
‘With our lives
’ Jason says
 ‘He’s the straightest shooter you’ll find
 And he had his reasons to help Gianni
 If your friends in the police don’t work out who the guy is
 then I promise I’ll tell them
 But I reckon they’re bright enough to work it out
’
‘Why did Gianni send you the photograph
 Jason
’ asks Ibrahim
Jason shrugs
 ‘I think he just wanted us to know it was him
 Showing off
 Gianni was always like that
 He could find my address pretty easy too
 everyone knows me round here
 Whatever Gianni did
 he always had to tell you
’
‘And did Gianni look the same
 What was his new name
’ asks Elizabeth
Jason shakes his head
 ‘None of our business
 We just asked what we asked
 We just wanted to know for sure
 That was enough
’
‘Shame
’ says Elizabeth
‘Well
 if the police don’t track him down
 I’m sure you four will
’ says Jason
 ‘And listen
 me and Bobby
 we just wanted to say thank you
 For bringing us together and for helping us get to the truth
 None of this would have happened without you
 Let’s be honest
 without you I’d probably be banged up for this
 So I got you all a little something
 if that’s OK
’
That’s definitely OK
 Jason unzips a sports bag at his feet and pulls out his gifts
 He hands a wooden box to Ibrahim
‘Ibrahim
 cigars
 Cuban
 of course
’
‘That is the height of urbanity
 Jason
 thank you
’ says Ibrahim
The next gift goes to Ron
‘Dad
 a bottle of wine
 and a nice one too
 You can stop pretending you still prefer beer in front of me
’
Ron takes his gift
 ‘Ooh
 a drop of white
 Thanks
 Jase
’
Jason hands Joyce an envelope
 ‘Joyce
 two tickets to come up and see Celebrity Ice Dance being filmed next month
’
Joyce beams
‘VIP
 all that
 I thought you could bring Joanna
’
‘Not Joanna
’ says Joyce
 ‘It’s ITV
 and she won’t have that on
’
‘And Elizabeth
’ says Jason
 with nothing in his hand but his phone
 ‘My gift to you is this
’
Jason holds up his phone and
 very deliberately
 swipes his finger across the screen and then puts it back in his pocket
 He looks to Elizabeth
 who isn’t sure how to react
‘Well
 thank you
 Jason
 although I was rather hoping for some Coco by Chanel
’ says Elizabeth
‘I think I know what you’d like more than that though
’ says Jason
 ‘To catch whoever killed Ian Ventham
’
‘Is that in your gift
 Jason
’ asks Elizabeth
‘I reckon it is
 Dad and I worked it out
 Didn’t we
 Dad
’
Ron nods
 ‘We did
 Son
’
‘And
 without wanting to sound cocky
’ says Jason
 ‘I reckon that one little swipe will confirm it
’
103
Joyce
I wonder if you know about Tinder
I had heard about it on the radio
 heard jokes about it
 but I had never seen it before Jason showed me
If you know what it is then you can skip through this bit
So Tinder is for dating
 You post pictures of yourself on an app
 An app is like the internet
 but only on your phone
 Jason showed me some of the pictures
 The pictures of the men are usually on a mountain
 or chopping down a tree
 Sometimes the pictures have been cropped down the middle to cut out a former partner
 Thanks to my picture in Cut to the Chase I know how they do that now
The pictures of the women are often on boats
 or with groups of other women
 and you’re not sure which one you’re supposed to be looking at
 so I suppose you take pot luck
I asked him if people use it for ‘one-night stands’ and he says that
 by and large
 people use it for little else
 Well
 that’s a bit of fun
 you could say
 but the whole thing felt unhappy to me
 And the more smiles I saw
 the unhappier I felt
Perhaps that’s just me
 I met Gerry at a dance I had decided to go to at the last minute to spite my mother
 If I hadn’t gone then we never would have met
 So I know that’s an inefficient way of finding true love
 but it worked for us
 From the moment I laid my eyes on him
 he didn’t stand a chance
 The lucky thing
So
 on Tinder you scroll through photographs of single people who live nearby
 Or sometimes married people who live nearby
 There is a picture of Ian Ventham on Tinder
 in a karate suit
 even though he’s dead
Every time you like the look of someone you swipe their picture to the right (or to the left
 I can’t remember)
 Meanwhile
 somewhere nearby they are scrolling through pictures too and if they like the look of you they also swipe to the right (or left) and the two of you are a match
Honestly
 it breaks your heart to scroll through
 It’s reminded me of those photos of lost cats you see on lamp posts
 It’s all that hope
 I think
Anyway
 when Jason swiped left or right he was confident of a match
 And he was confident that match would be the killer
 I trust his confidence on the first matter
 I am more dubious about the second
There is another dating app for gay men called Grindr
 Perhaps it’s for gay women too
 I don’t know
 I didn’t ask
 Would they use the same one
 That would be nice I think
So Jason imagines he has solved the case
 And perhaps he has
 though I doubt it very much
 He says it’s obvious
 but often
 in these matters
 the answer isn’t obvious at all
At least I have discovered that online dating is not for me
 You can have too much choice in this world
 And when everyone has too much choice
 it is also much harder to get chosen
 And we all want to be chosen
Goodnight all
 Goodnight Bernard
 And goodnight Gerry
 my love

Having spent a very happy morning preparing
 changing outfits and texting friends
 Karen Playfair is now alone for a moment
 sitting in an unfamiliar armchair
 She is shaking her head
 thinking about the optimism of this morning and then the reality of the lunch she’s just had
Karen has had some bad dates on Tinder
 But this was the first time that someone had accused her of murder
The match had pinged onto her phone yesterday evening
 Jason Ritchie
 Well
 I don’t mind if I do
 she had thought
 This is a cut above your average
 He’d messaged
 she’d messaged
 and before you knew it
 there they were in Le Pont Noir
 ordering a crayfish salad with radicchio
 A whirlwind romance in the offing
Karen shifts in her armchair and idly picks up a magazine from a pile on the coffee table
 It’s more of a newsletter really
 Cut to the Chase
Back to the date
 There had been some small talk
 not too much
 Karen knew very little about boxing and Jason knew very little about IT
 Lightly sparkling water arrived
 and that’s when Jason mentioned Ian Ventham
 Karen immediately realized that this wasn’t a date
 and felt foolish
 But worse was to come
She can hear Ron Ritchie in his kitchen now
 he’s opening a bottle of wine
 Jason’s nipped to the loo
 She starts flicking through Cut to the Chase
 but her mind keeps going back to Le Pont Noir
All those questions Jason had fired at her
 Hadn’t she been there the morning Ian Ventham was killed
 Yes she had
 Wasn’t her dad refusing to sell his land to Ian Ventham
 Well
 yes he was
 but
 look
 here comes our crayfish
 Didn’t she want her dad to sell the land
 to take the money
 That was her advice
 yes
 but it was her dad’s business
 Surely if he sold
 then some of that money would be coming to her
 Well
 you could certainly assume that
 Jason
 but why not just come out with it and say what you want to say
And so he did
 It was almost funny
 thinks Karen
 reliving it
 She hears the loo flush
 What was it he had said
Jason had leaned forward
 very sure – certain
 in fact
 You see
 the police had been looking for someone who was there in the 1970s and was still there now
 and they had been right in a way
 They’d found bones and maybe someone had been murdered
 all those years ago
 But forget the bones
 they were missing the simplest trick in the book
 greed
 Ventham was in the way of Karen making her millions
 Her dad wasn’t budging
 and so Ventham had to go
 Jason mentioned some drugs you could only get on the dark web and didn’t Karen work in IT
 Wasn’t that convenient
 Jason had solved the case and felt sure he was about to get a confession
 Honestly
 some men!
He hadn’t expected Karen to laugh in his face and explain that she was a database administrator for a secondary school
 who could no more access the dark web than fly to the moon
 That she had misheard Jason’s mention of fentanyl as Ventolin and had wondered what he was on about
 That she lived in one of the most beautiful places in England
 and while she would certainly swap that for a million pounds
 she would rather be there with her dad happy
 than in some executive new-build in Hove
 with her dad miserable
 Jason looked like he was going to come back with a clever response but
 when he tried
 none came
Jason walks back into the room and Karen remembers how crestfallen he had looked
 He knew she was telling him the truth
 That his little theory was wrong
 He had apologized and offered to leave
 but Karen had wondered if they shouldn’t make the best out of a bad deal and enjoy the rest of their lunch
 What if they ended up together
 Wouldn’t this be the greatest ‘and how did you two meet’ story of all time
 Which set them both laughing and set them both talking and turned the whole thing into a lovely
 long
 boozy lunch
Which is why Jason had asked her back here for another drink and to do a bit of explaining to his dad
Right on cue
 Ron Ritchie walks in with a nice bottle of white and three glasses
Jason sits down next to her and takes the glasses from his dad
 He really has been charm itself since he accused her of murder
Karen Playfair puts her copy of Cut to the Chase back down on the pile
 And as she does
 she sees the photograph
 Halfway down the page
 She picks the newsletter up again and stares closely
 Just to make sure
‘You all right
 Karen
’ asks Jason
 as Ron pours the wine
‘The police wanted someone who was here in the seventies
 who’s still here now
’ asks Karen
 slowly and carefully
‘That’s what they reckon
’ says Jason
 ‘Obviously
 I thought they were wrong
 but we saw how that played out
’
Jason laughs
 but Karen does not
 She looks at Ron and points to the face in the photograph
 ‘Someone who was here in the seventies and is still here now
’
Ron looks
 but his brain won’t take it in
‘You’re sure
’ he manages to ask
‘It was a long time ago
 but I’m sure
’
Ron’s mind is travelling at speed
 This can’t be
 He’s searching for reasons why this must be wrong
 but can find none
 He puts the wine down on the coffee table and picks up Cut to the Chase
‘I need to go and talk to Elizabeth
’

Steve’s Gym looks a lot like its owner
 A squat
 brick building
 intimidating at first sight
 but with the door always open and everyone always welcome
Chris and Donna step over the threshold
After the excitement in the graveyard yesterday
 Chris and Donna had gone back to Fairhaven and checked on Joe Kyprianou’s hunch about the original investigation
 No one from Kent Police had ventured into Northern Cyprus
 There was no mention of Gianni’s family connections
 There had been no meaningful investigation at all
 Chris had seen the names of the two officers who had been sent to Nicosia
 No surprises
 They’d have come back with tans and hangovers and nothing else
He and Donna had then been having another look at all those passenger lists
 coming in from Larnaca to Heathrow and Gatwick in the week before the murder
 Nearly three thousand names
 mainly men and mainly Cypriots
Looking through list after list of names
 Chris remembered something else that Joe Kyprianou had said
 If Gianni had come to the UK
 he would have needed help
 A fellow Cypriot would be the obvious choice
 Did Chris know any
As the names flashed before his eyes
 he realized that he did
They had then gone back to the original Tony Curran file
 There was no doubt that
 in the early days
 Steve Georgiou had been in and around the Tony Curran crew
 Mentioned in dispatches
 but never anything to bring him in for
 And whatever he had been doing for Tony hadn’t lasted long
 He’d opened Steve’s Gym ages ago and it had gone from strength to strength
 as it were
 Chris and Donna both knew officers who trained there
 Decent officers too
 not fools
 The place had a good reputation
 and that wasn’t the case with all gyms
Even today the gym was packed
 A Wednesday afternoon
 an atmosphere of quiet hard work
 no preening and posturing
 Chris has been meaning to join a gym
 but at the moment he was waiting for his knee to stop hurting
 No point aggravating it
 As soon as it has settled down
 he’ll join
 Take the bull by the horns
 He had felt a sharp
 stabbing pain in his arm after the run up the hill to the graveyard to save Elizabeth
 Almost certainly nothing
 but even so
Steve had been expecting them and met them by the door with a crushing handshake and a huge smile
 They are now in his office
 Steve is sitting on a yoga ball and chatting happily
‘Listen
 you know as well as anyone
 we don’t have trouble here
 and we don’t cause trouble here
’ says Steve Georgiou
‘I do know that
’ agrees Chris
‘The opposite
 innit
 You know that
 We take people in
 we turn them around
 No secrets
 you just ask whatever
 yeah
’
‘I was in Cyprus recently
 Steve
’
Steve stops smiling and bounces a little
 ‘OK …’
‘I didn’t really know much about it before I went
 I just thought holidays
 you know
’
‘It’s very beautiful
’ says Steve Georgiou
 ‘Are we just gossiping or what
’
‘What are you
 Steve
 Greek Cypriot or Turkish Cypriot
’ asks Donna
There’s a beat
 very short
 but very telling to a good copper
 Steve shakes his head
 ‘I don’t get involved in all that
 not for me
 People are people
’
‘We’re agreed on that
 Steve
’ says Chris
 ‘But even so
 What side of the line were you
 We can probably find out another way
 but since we’re here …’
‘Turkish
’ says Steve Georgiou
 ‘Turkish Cypriot
’ He shrugs
 it’s of no concern
Chris nods his head and and writes something down
 just keeping Steve waiting for a moment
 ‘Like Gianni Gunduz
’
Steve Georgiou tilts his head to the side and looks at Chris anew
 ‘That’s a name from a long time ago
’
‘Isn’t it
 though
’ says Chris
 ‘Anyway
 that’s why I was in Cyprus
 Trying to track him down
’
Steve Georgiou smiles
 ‘He’s long gone
 Gianni was crazy
 Good luck to the guy
 but someone would have killed him by now
 Guaranteed
’
‘Well
 that would explain why we can’t find him
 But
 you know
 Steve
 I’m a police officer
 and sometimes something doesn’t seem right
’
‘That’s the job
 innit
’ says Steve Georgiou
‘I want to suggest a story
’ says Chris
 ‘Just something we’ve been thinking about
 And you don’t have to say anything
 You don’t have to react
 just listen
 Can you do that
’
‘I’ve got to be honest with you
 I’ve got a gym to run and I still don’t know what you’re doing here
’
Donna holds up a hand and concedes the point
 ‘You’re right
 But just hear us out
 Two minutes and you’ll be back out there
’
‘Two minutes
’ accepts Steve
‘You’re one of the good guys
 Steve
’ says Chris
 ‘I know that
 I don’t hear a bad word about you
’
‘I appreciate that
 thank you
’ says Steve
‘But here’s what I worry has happened
’ continues Chris
 ‘I think a few weeks ago you get a message
 or maybe it’s just a knock at the door
 I don’t know
 Either way
 it’s Gianni Gunduz
’
‘Nope
’ says Steve Georgiou
 shaking his head
‘And Gianni needs help
 He’s back in town for something
 Maybe he doesn’t say what
 maybe he does
 And he turns to you
 a little favour
 for old times’ sake
 Somewhere to stay
 Maybe just that
 He doesn’t want a record of whatever his new name is anywhere in town
 And no one’s to know
’
‘I haven’t seen Gianni Gunduz in twenty years
 He’s dead
 or he’s in prison
 or he’s in Turkey
’ says Steve Georgiou
‘Maybe
’ says Chris
 ‘But Gianni could be trouble if he doesn’t get what he wants
 He could burn this place down pretty easily
 I’d have thought
 He’s the type to do it too
 so maybe you had no choice
 And it’s only a couple of days
 He’s just got to deliver a couple of things
 then tie up a loose end
 Then he’d be gone
 How does that sound to you
 Steve
’
Steve Georgiou shrugs
 ‘Like a pretty dangerous story
’
‘You’ve got a flat above the gym
’ asks Donna
Steve nods
‘Who stays there
’
‘Anyone who needs to
 Not everyone who comes in here is from a stable background
 A kid tells me he can’t go home
 I don’t ask the reason
 I just hand him the keys
 It’s a safe place
’
‘Who was staying in the flat on June the seventeenth
’ asks Chris
‘No idea
 I’m not the Hilton
 Maybe some kid
 maybe me
’
‘Maybe no one
’ asks Donna
Steve Georgiou shrugs
‘But you think maybe someone
’ says Chris
‘Maybe
’
‘Gianni is very well connected
 Steve
 In Cyprus
’ says Chris
‘Not my world
’
‘You’ve still got family over there
’ asks Donna
‘Yes
’ says Steve Georgiou
 ‘Lot of family
’
‘Steve
 if Gianni Gunduz had come here and asked if he could stay
’ begins Chris
 ‘If he put pressure on you of any kind
 Or maybe he paid you
 If you agreed
 If he slept upstairs on June seventeenth
 There’s no way you would tell me
’
‘No
’
‘Consequences too great
 Consequences for family in Cyprus
’
‘I think that’s been two minutes
 if we’re honest
’
‘Agreed
’ says Chris
 ‘Thank you
 Steve
’
‘Any time
 You’re always welcome here
 I mean that
 We could sort that gut out in a heartbeat
’
Chris smiles
 ‘It had crossed my mind
 Steve
 I don’t suppose there’s any way I could take a look upstairs before I go
 Just see if Gianni left anything
’
Steve Georgiou shakes his head
 ‘You could do me a favour though
’
‘Go on
’ says Chris
‘Could you stick this in Lost Property
 Someone dropped it a couple of weeks ago and I’ve asked and asked
 but I don’t know who it belongs to
’ Steve reaches into a drawer and pulls out a clear plastic wallet
 filled with cash
 and hands it to Chris
 ‘Five thousand euros
 Some tourist must be kicking themselves
’
Chris looks at the cash
 looks at Donna
 then back at Steve
 Would this have prints on it
 Doubtful
 but at least Steve is letting him know he’s right
 ‘You don’t want to keep it
’
Steve Georgiou shakes his head
 ‘Nope
 I know where it’s been
’
Chris hands the envelope to Donna and she puts it in an evidence bag
 They both know that Steve Georgiou has just been very brave
 Chris stands and shakes him by the hand
‘I know Tony Curran was a bastard
’ says Steve Georgiou
 ‘But he didn’t deserve that
’
‘Agreed
’ says Chris
 ‘Up to a point
 Anyway
 Me and my gut will be back here soon
’
‘Good lad
’
106
Elizabeth leaves Stephen sleeping
 Bogdan will be around after work for a game of chess
 She hopes they will both be there when she gets back
 She’ll need the company
The knob has come off the bedroom wardrobe door and Elizabeth casually leaves it on the kitchen table
 She bets that Bogdan won’t be able to resist fixing it
Ron had come to her with the photograph that Karen Playfair had seen
 Karen would have been young at the time
 but she was sure
 Elizabeth had tried to piece it all together in her head
 It seemed impossible at first
 But the more she thought about it
 it began to seem horribly true
 She worked out the steps
 one by one
 Ibrahim had come back an hour ago
 with the final piece of the jigsaw
 so now is the time
 The case is solved and only justice remains
Elizabeth walks out into the cold evening air
 not turning back now
 The skies are getting darker earlier and the scarves are coming out of the wardrobes
 Summer is still keeping a lid on autumn
 but it won’t be long
 How many more autumns for Elizabeth
 How many more years of slipping on a pair of comfortable boots and walking through the leaves
 One day
 spring will come without her
 The daffodils will always come up by the lake
 but you won’t always be there to see them
 So it goes
 enjoy them while you can
But right now
 with the job at hand
 Elizabeth feels an affinity with the late summer
 The leaves clinging gamely on
 the last hurrah of the heat
 the odd trick still up its sleeve
She sees Ron making his way over
 grim-faced
 but ready
 Hiding his limp
 keeping his pain to himself
 What a fine friend Ron is
 she thinks
 What a heart he has
 Long may it go on beating
As she turns the corner she sees Ibrahim waiting by the door
 folder in hand
 The last piece of the jigsaw
 How handsome he looks
 dressed for the occasion
 ready to do whatever’s necessary
 That Ibrahim might ever die seems absurd to Elizabeth
 He will certainly be the last of them
 The last oak in the forest
 standing still and true
 as the aeroplanes whizz overhead
How to begin
 thinks Elizabeth
 How to even begin
107
Chris gets the nod
 An international warrant has been issued for the arrest of Gianni Gunduz for questioning over the murder of Tony Curran
 A good end to the day
 The euros Steve Georgiou gave them had no prints
 but had been taken out at a bureau de change in Northern Cyprus three days before Tony Curran’s murder
 He’d given Joe Kyprianou the address of the bureau
 in case of CCTV
 but Joe had taken one look at the address and laughed
 No chance
Would the Cypriot authorities ever find him
 Who knew
 You’d think so
 but after the initial rush
 how hard is anyone really going to look
 Maybe Chris will even get another trip over to Cyprus
 That would be nice
 Either way
 he’s done all he can and it’s up to the Cypriots now
 if they fancy their chances
 Whatever happens
 Chris will look good
It is a cause for celebration
 but Chris has had too many nights in the pub with too many coppers over the years
 What he’d really wanted was a curry at home
 get Donna round
 watch something on TV
 bottle of wine and send her home at ten
 Maybe talk a bit about Ventham
 What have they missed
Chris had a worrying thought earlier
 A stupid one
 really
 Only
 hadn’t the convent had a hospital
 all those years ago
 Wasn’t Joyce an ex-nurse
 Run the name Joyce Meadowcroft through the computer
 Could he talk to Donna about it
But Donna had a mystery date tonight
 Casually dropped it into the conversation on the way back from Steve’s Gym
 So
 he would go home and have a night in by himself
 with a curry
 Chris knew that was where this was heading
 The darts was on Sky
Chris wondered whether this was a tragic plan
 or simply the sort of plan that people would think was tragic
 Was he a content man
 doing the things he liked alone
 Or was he a lonely man
 making the best out of what he had
 Alone
 or lonely
 This question cropped up so often these days
 Chris could no longer be confident of his answer
 Though if he were a betting man
 his money would be on lonely
Where was his date
If he leaves right now
 it will be rush hour
 So Chris closes the Tony Curran file and opens up the Ventham file
 If he can solve one murder
 he can surely solve two more
 What has he missed
 Who has he missed
108
They make their way along the corridor
 Elizabeth and Ibrahim
 with Ron carrying a couple of extra chairs
 A job to do
Behind them
 double doors swing open and Joyce hurries after her friends
‘Sorry I’m late
 The beeper was going off on my oven and I couldn’t work out why
’
‘Sometimes it can be a very brief power outage
 Then the clock tries to reset itself
’ says Ibrahim
Joyce nods
 Without thinking
 she takes Ibrahim’s hand
 Ahead of them Elizabeth has taken Ron’s hand too and they walk in silence until they reach the door
Despite the circumstances
 Elizabeth knocks
 As she always does
She opens the door and there he is
 The man Karen Playfair had recognized after all those years
 His picture next to Ron
 holding the fox that he had saved
The same old book is open at the same old page
 He looks up and seems unsurprised to see the four of them
‘Ah
 the gang’s all here
’
‘The gang’s all here
 John
’ confirms Elizabeth
 ‘Do you mind if we sit
’
John gestures for them to do exactly that
 He puts down his book and pinches the bridge of his nose
 Ron looks over at Penny
 comatose on the bed
 Nothing left of her
 really
 he thinks
 Gone
 Why hasn’t he been to see her
 Why had it taken this
‘How shall we do this
 John
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Up to you
 Elizabeth
’ replies John
 ‘I’ve been waiting for that knock since the moment I did it
 Just took each day as a bonus
 I do wish you’d taken a bit longer
 though
 What was it
 in the end
’
‘Karen Playfair recognized you
’ said Ibrahim
John nods and smiles to himself
 ‘Did she
 Little Karen
 Goodness!’
‘You put her dog to sleep when she was six
 John
’ says Joyce
 ‘She says she would never forget your kind eyes
’
Elizabeth is in her customary seat at the foot of Penny’s bed
 ‘Do you want to start
 John
 Or shall we
’
‘Shall I
’ says John
 and shuts his eyes
 ‘I’ve been over it so many times in my head
’
‘Who is in the grave
 John
 Whose bones are they
’
Eyes still shut
 John looks up to the heavens
 lets out a sigh from the ages and begins
‘It would have been the early seventies
 maybe ten miles from here
 Greyscott
 one of the sheep farms
 There used to be any number around here
 you know
 Long time ago now
 I think I’d started in 1967
 Penny would remember for sure
 but around then anyway
 The farmer was an old boy called Matheson and I knew him well enough by that point
 I’d go out there every now and again
 You know
 something would happen
 This time around
 he’d had a mare just given birth
 The foal had died and the mare was in distress
 She was in such pain
 screaming
 and he hadn’t wanted to shoot her
 which I understood
 so I gave her an injection and that was that
 Done it many times
 before and since
 Some farmers will just shoot them
 some vets will too
 but not Matheson and not me
 Anyway
 he made me a cup of tea and we got chatting
 I was always in a hurry
 but I think he was a very lonely man
 There was no family
 no one to help him on the farm
 money running out
 so I think he welcomed the company
 It was very bleak up there
 that’s how it seemed to me that day
 I had to be on my way
 but he didn’t want me to leave
 You will judge me
 I know
 or perhaps you won’t
 but suddenly something seemed clear as day to me
 He was in distress
 great distress
 If Matheson had been an animal he would have been screaming
 You have to believe that
 And so I reached into my bag and I offered him a flu shot
 you know
 see him through the winter and all that
 He was glad of the offer
 He rolled up his sleeve and I gave him his shot
 The same shot I’d just given the mare
 And that was the end of the screaming and the end of the pain
’
‘You put him out of his misery
 John
’ asks Joyce
‘That’s how I saw it
 Then and now
 If I’d had my wits about me I would have conjured up some clever little concoction
 something that wouldn’t show up in a post-mortem
 and left him there to be found by the postman
 or the milk van
 or whoever knocked there next
 But it was spur of the moment
 so there he was
 pumped full of pentobarbital and I couldn’t take the risk that someone might look into it
’
‘So you had to bury him
 This Matheson
’ asks Elizabeth
‘Quite so
 I would have buried him there and then
 but you’ll remember they were buying up farmland left
 right and centre those days
 building houses everywhere
 and I thought it’d be just my luck to bury him
 then have him dug up by builders a month later
 And that’s when I remembered
’
‘The graveyard
’ says Ron
‘It was perfect
 I knew it from visiting Gordon Playfair
 It wasn’t on farmland
 and no one was going to be buying a convent
 for heaven’s sake
 I knew how quiet it was
 I knew no one visited
 So I drove up one night
 a couple of days later
 lights off
 Picked up my spade and did the deed
 And that was that
 until one day
 forty years later
 I saw an advert for this place
’
‘And here we all are
’ says Elizabeth
‘And here we all are
 I persuaded Penny it would be a lovely place to retire to
 and I wasn’t wrong there
 I just wanted to keep an eye on things
 You think they won’t dig up a graveyard
 but you never know these days
 and I wanted to be close by in case the worst happened
’
‘Which it did
 John
’ says Joyce
‘I couldn’t dig the body back up
 too old
 too feeble
 And I couldn’t risk the grave being dug up and the body being found
 So in the panic of that morning
 in all the chaos while we were holding him back
 I slid a syringe into Ventham’s arm and seconds later he was dead
 Which is unforgivable in every way
 Unforgivable
 And from that moment I’ve been waiting for you to come
 and I’ve been waiting to face the consequences of what I’ve done
’
‘How did you magically have a syringe filled with fentanyl
 John
’ asks Elizabeth
John smiles
 ‘I’ve had it for a long time
 In case I ever needed it here
 If they ever wanted to move Penny
’
John looks at Elizabeth
 through clear eyes
‘I’m glad it was you at least
 Elizabeth and not the police
 I’m glad you solved it
 I knew you would
’
‘I’m glad too
 John
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘And thank you for telling your story
 You know we will have to tell the police
’
‘I know
’
‘We don’t need to do it this very second though
 While it’s just us
 can I clarify two little things
’
‘Of course
 It was a long time ago
 but I’ll help if I can
’
‘I think you and I agree
 John
 that Penny probably doesn’t hear what goes on in this room
 Whatever silly nonsense we say to her
 That we’re kidding ourselves
 really
’
John nods
‘But I think we’re also agreed that maybe she can
 Just maybe
 Maybe she hears it all
’
‘Maybe
’ agrees John
‘In which case
 John
 perhaps she can hear us now
’
‘Perhaps
’
‘Even if there’s the slightest chance
 John
 The slightest chance that Penny heard what you just said
 Why would you do that to her
 Why put her through that
’
‘Well
 I …’
‘You wouldn’t
 John
 that’s the truth
 That would have been torture
’ says Elizabeth
Ibrahim sits forward
 ‘John
 you said that killing Ian Ventham was unforgivable
 And I believe
 truly
 that you mean that
 It was an act beyond your imagining
 And yet you ask us to believe that you committed that act simply to save your own skin
 That doesn’t ring true
 I’m afraid
 You committed an act you knew to be unforgivable
 And I’m afraid we see only one reason for that
’
‘Love
 John
’ says Joyce
 ‘Always love
’
John looks at the four of them
 Each implacable
‘I sent Ibrahim to have a look at one of Penny’s files this morning
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Ibrahim
’
Ibrahim takes a small manila file from his shopping bag and hands it to Elizabeth
 She opens the file on her lap
‘Shall we get to the truth
’
109
Chris is alone
 The remains of a takeaway curry are in front of him
 Michael van Gerwen dispatched Peter Wright by six sets to love
 finishing the darts early
 So now there is nothing on TV and no one to watch it with
 He is wondering whether he should go to the twenty-four-hour garage for some crisps
 Just to take the edge off
His phone buzzes
 That’s something
 at least
 It’s Donna
Might watch Jason Ritchie’s Famous Family Trees on catch-up
 You fancy
Chris looks at his watch
 it’s nearly ten
 Why not
 Another buzz
And wear your dark blue shirt
 please
 The one with the buttons
Chris is used to Donna by now
 so does as he is told
 As always
 he gets changed without looking in a mirror
 because who wants to see that
 He texts back
Yes ma’am
 anything for a bit of Jason Ritchie
 On my way
Donna’s date had clearly not been a roaring success
110
‘She keeps them in storage
 John
’ says Elizabeth
 holding the manila file
 ‘I don’t know if you’ve ever been
 It’s files of all her old cases
 You’re not supposed to keep them
 but you know Penny
 She made copies of everything
 just in case
’
‘In case they might help catch a killer many years later
’ says Joyce
‘Anyway
 John
 after Karen Playfair recognized you
 it got me thinking
 and I just needed one final thing checking in one of the files
’
‘Would you like some water
 John
’ asks Joyce
John shakes his head
 His eyes are on Elizabeth as she begins to read from the file
‘There was a case in Rye
 in 1973
 Penny must have been very junior
 I can’t imagine Penny ever having been junior
 but you must remember it very clearly
 Probably seems like yesterday
 The case concerned a girl named Annie Madeley
 You remember Annie Madeley
 Penny
’
Elizabeth looks over to where her friend is lying
 Listening
 Not listening
‘Stabbed during a burglary and bled to death in the arms of her boyfriend
 Around came the police
 including Penny
 that’s in the file
 Found broken glass on the floor
 where our burglar had got in
 but nothing stolen
 The burglar had been surprised by Annie Madeley
 panicked
 picked up a kitchen knife
 stabbed her and fled
 That’s the official account if you want to read it
 Case closed
 But Ron was the first to sniff it out
 he didn’t like it one bit
’
‘It stunk
 Johnny
’ says Ron
 ‘A burglar in the middle of the day
 on a busy estate
 With people at home
 You might burgle on a Sunday morning
 while everyone is at church
 but not Sunday afternoon
 not the done thing
’
Elizabeth looks over to her friend
 ‘You must have thought that too
 Penny
 You must have known the boyfriend had stabbed her
 waited for her to die
 then called the police
’
She dabs Penny’s dry lips
‘We started looking into it months ago
 John
 The Thursday Murder Club
 No Penny
 but we carried on
 I was surprised we’d never looked at the case before
 surprised Penny had never brought it in
 We started looking at it
 John
 seeing if the police had got it wrong all those years ago
 I read the report on the knife wound and it didn’t seem right to me
 so I asked Joyce about it
 In fact
 it might have been the first thing I ever asked you
 Joyce
’
‘It was
’ remembers Joyce
‘I described the wound and asked her how long it would take to die
 and she said around forty-five minutes or so
 which didn’t fit the boyfriend’s account at all
 He had chased the burglar – no one saw this
 John – rushed back to the kitchen
 held Annie Madeley in his arms and rang the police immediately
 I then asked Joyce if someone with any medical training could have saved her and what did you say
 Joyce
’
‘I was certain
 it would have been easy
 You’ll know that too
 John
 with your training
’
‘Now the boyfriend had been a soldier
 John
 invalided out a few years before
 So he could have saved her
 no question
 But that’s not the way the investigation went
 I’d like to say that things were different in these cases back then
 but no doubt he’d get away with it today too
 They searched for the burglar
 but with no luck
 Poor Annie Madeley was buried and the world kept turning
 The boyfriend disappeared shortly afterwards
 in the middle of the night
 with rent owing and we come to the end of the file
’
‘So we were looking into all of this
 but then events took over
 of course
’ says Ibrahim
 ‘Mr Curran
 Mr Ventham
 the body in the graveyard
 We put the case to one side while we had a real murder right in front of us
’
‘But we all know we don’t come to the end of the story
 don’t we
 John
’ says Ron
Elizabeth taps the manila file
‘And so I sent Ibrahim off to look at the file
 with one question
 Can you guess what it was
 John
’
John stares at her
 Elizabeth looks at Penny
‘Penny
 if you can hear
 I bet you know the question
 Peter Mercer
 that was the name of the boyfriend
 Peter Mercer
 I asked Ibrahim to find out why Peter Mercer had been invalided from the army
 And if you hadn’t guessed the question
 I bet you can guess the answer
 John
 Have a go
 it’s all too late anyway
’
John buries his head in his hands
 drags them down his face and looks up
 ‘I assume
 Elizabeth
 it was a gunshot wound to the lower leg
’
‘It was just that
 John
’
Elizabeth pulls her chair nearer to Penny
 takes her hand and speaks to her quietly and directly
 ‘Nearly fifty years ago Peter Mercer murdered his girlfriend
 then vanished into thin air
 And everyone thought he’d got away with it
 But it’s really not all that easy to get away with murder
 is it
 Penny
 Sometimes justice is waiting just around the corner
 as it was for Peter Mercer one dark night when you paid him a visit
 And sometimes justice waits fifty years and sits beside a hospital bed holding the hand of a friend
 Had you just seen one too many of these cases
 Penny
 Tired of it
 And tired of no one listening
’
‘When did she tell you
 John
’ asks Joyce
John starts to cry
‘When she was first ill
’
John nods slowly
 ‘She didn’t mean to tell me
 You remember how she was
 Elizabeth
 The mini-strokes
’
‘Yes
’ remembers Elizabeth
 They were very gentle at first
 Nothing too alarming
 unless you knew what they were
 But poor John had known exactly what they were
‘She would say all sorts of things
 See all sorts of things
 Plenty of make-believe
 and then the present sort of disappeared and her mind would go further and further back
 Kept spooling back until it found something familiar I suppose
 Just looking for something that made sense
 because the world around her had stopped making sense
 So she’d tell me stories
 sometimes from her childhood
 sometimes from when we first met
’
‘And sometimes from her early days in the police
’ prompts Elizabeth
‘All things I’d heard before at first
 Things I remember from the time
 old bosses
 little scams they’d pull
 fiddling expenses
 pub instead of court
 the sorts of things we’d always laughed about
 I knew she was adrift and I wanted to hold on to her as long as I could
 Do you understand
’
‘We all do
 John
’ says Ron
 And they do
‘So I would keep her talking
 The same stories over and over again sometimes
 One reminding her of another
 reminding her of another
 reminding her of the first one again
 and round we’d go
 But then …’
John pauses and looks at his wife
‘You say you don’t really think Penny can hear you
 John
’ says Elizabeth
John shakes his head
 slowly
 ‘No
’
‘And yet every day
 you come here
 You sit with her
 You talk to her
’
‘What else is there for me to do
 Elizabeth
’
Elizabeth understands
 ‘So
 she was telling you stories
 Stories you knew
 And then one day …
’
‘Yes
 and then one day it was stories I didn’t know
’
‘Secrets
’ says Ron
‘Secrets
 Nothing awful
 only little things
 She’d taken money once
 A bribe
 Everyone else had taken it and she felt she’d had to
 She told me that as if she had told me many times before
 but she hadn’t
 We all have secrets
 don’t we
’
‘We do
 John
’ agrees Elizabeth
‘She’d forgotten what was a funny story and what was a secret
 But there must have been something still working
 a final lock on a final gate
 The last thing to give
’
‘The worst secret of all
’
John nods
 ‘By God she held on to it
 She was already in here
 You remember when they moved her in
’
Elizabeth remembers
 Penny had gone by this time
 Conversations were snippets
 incoherent
 sometimes angry
 When would Stephen come in here
 She needed to get back to him
 Just get this done and go home and kiss her beautiful husband
‘She didn’t even recognize me by then
 Well
 she recognized me
 but she couldn’t place me
 I came in one morning
 About two months ago
 you know
 and she was sitting up
 It was the last time I remember her sitting up
 And she saw me
 and she knew me
 She asked me what we were going to do and I didn’t understand the question
 so I asked her
 “Do about what
”’
Elizabeth nods
‘And she started to tell me
 and she was very matter of fact
 As if there was something in the loft and she needed me to get it down
 Nothing more than that
 Nothing more than that
 You know I couldn’t let people find out what she’d done
 Elizabeth
 You know that
 I had to try something
’
Elizabeth nods
‘We’d picnicked up on the hill a few times
’ John continues
 ‘It really was very beautiful
 I’d always wondered why we stopped
’
They sit in silence
 Broken only by the quiet electronic beeps by Penny’s bedside
 All that remained of her
 like a lighthouse blinking far out to sea
Elizabeth gently breaks the silence
 ‘Here’s what I think we should do
 John
 I’m going to get the others to take you home
 It’s late
 have a sleep in your own bed
 If you have letters to write
 then write them
 I’ll come with the police in the morning
 I know you’ll be there
 We’ll step outside for a moment so you can say goodbye to Penny
’
The four friends step outside and Elizabeth watches through the clear border of the frosted window in Penny’s door as John holds his wife in his arms
 She looks away
‘You’ll see John back safely
 won’t you
 If I stay with Penny for a moment
’ she asks the others
 and gets nods in return
 She opens the door again
 John is putting on his coat
‘Time to go
 John
’
111
The lights in Donna’s flat are low and Stevie Wonder is working his magic from the speakers
 Chris is happy and relaxed
 shoes off
 feet up
 Donna pours him a glass of wine
‘Thanks
 Donna
’
‘Pleasure
 Nice shirt by the way
’
‘Why thank you
 It’s just something I threw on
’
Chris smiles at Donna and Donna smiles back
 Donna can sense what is about to happen and it makes her very happy
‘Mum
’ inquires Donna
 holding the bottle towards her mother
‘Thank you
 darling
 I will
’
Donna then pours a glass of wine for her mother
 currently sitting beside Chris on the sofa
‘Honestly
 you could be her sister
 Patrice
’ says Chris
 ‘And I’m not just saying that because Donna is ageing so badly
’
Donna mimes throwing up while Patrice laughs
‘Madonna told me you were charming
’
Chris puts down his wine
 a look of delight creeping onto his face
 ‘Sorry
 Who told you I was charming
’
‘Madonna
’ she tilts her head towards her daughter
Chris looks at Donna
 ‘Your full name is Madonna
’
‘If you ever call me that I will taser you
’ says Donna
‘It would be worth it
’ says Chris
 ‘Patrice
 I think I love you
’
Donna rolls her eyes and picks up the remote
 ‘Shall we watch Jason Ritchie
’
‘Sure
 sure
’ says Chris
 distracted
 ‘So what do you do for a living
 Patrice
’
‘I teach
 Primary
’ says Patrice
‘Do you
’ says Chris
 Teacher
 sings in a choir
 loves dogs
 that’s his fantasy checklist
Donna looks Chris straight in the eye
 ‘And she sings in the choir on a Sunday
’
Chris refuses to hold Donna’s gaze and turns back to Patrice
‘This is going to sound like a ridiculous question
 Patrice
 but do you like dogs
’
Patrice takes a sip of her wine
 ‘Allergic
 I’m afraid
’
Chris nods
 and sips
 then gives his glass an almost imperceptible raise towards Donna
 Two out of three ain’t bad
 He is glad he is wearing his blue shirt with the buttons
‘What happened to your date
’ Chris asks Donna
‘I just said I had a date
 I didn’t say it was my date
’ replies Donna
Donna’s phone buzzes
 She looks at the screen
‘It’s Elizabeth
 She wonders if we’re free tomorrow morning
 Nothing urgent
’
‘Solved the case no doubt
’
Donna laughs
 She hopes everything is OK with her friend
112
Penny’s bedside lamp is turned as low as it can go
 just enough light for two old friends with familiar faces
 Elizabeth has Penny’s hand in hers
‘So
 did anyone get away with anything
 darling
 Tony Curran didn’t
 did he
 Someone did for him
 Gianni
 so everyone seems to think
 though I have a theory about that I must discuss with Joyce
 No loss there
 anyway
 And Ventham
 Well
 you know John has to pay for that
 I’ll take the police there in the morning and they’ll find his body
 we both know that
 The moment he’s home
 a little nightcap and that’s that
 He knows enough to make it peaceful at least
 doesn’t he
’
Elizabeth strokes Penny’s hair
‘And what about you
 darling
 You clever girl
 Did you get away with it
 I know why you did what you did
 Penny
 I see the choice you made
 to deliver your own justice
 I don’t agree with it
 but I see it
 I wasn’t there
 I wasn’t facing what you were facing
 But did you get away with it
’
Elizabeth places Penny’s hand back on the bed and stands
‘It all rather depends
 doesn’t it
 On whether you can hear me or not
 If you can hear
 Penny
 you’ll know that the man you love has just walked off into the night to die
 All because he wanted to protect you
 And that all comes down to the choice you made all those years ago
 And I think that’s punishment enough
 Penny
’
Elizabeth starts to put on her coat
‘And if you can’t hear me
 then you got away with it
 dear
 Bravo!’
Elizabeth’s coat is now on and she places a hand on her friend’s cheek
‘I know what John did while he was holding you
 Penny
 I saw the syringe
 So I know you’re off too
 and that this is goodbye
 Darling
 I haven’t really spoken about Stephen recently
 He’s not at all well and I’m trying my best
 but I’m losing him bit by bit
 So I have my secrets too
’
She kisses Penny’s cheek
‘Dear God I will miss you
 you fool
 Sweet dreams
 darling
 What a chase!’
Elizabeth leaves Willows and walks out into the darkness
 A quiet
 cloudless night
 A night so dark you think you might never see morning again
113
Chris takes a taxi home and walks the long walk up to his flat
 Is it the booze
 or is he a little lighter on his feet
He opens his front door and surveys the scene
 A few things would need to be tidied away for sure
 take the recycling out
 maybe buy some cushions and a candle
 The bathroom door still stuck whenever it was opened
 but nothing that a bit of sandpaper and hard work wouldn’t fix
 Go to Tesco’s
 buy some fruit
 put it in a bowl on the dining table
 Of course
 also buy a fruit bowl
 Clean the bedding
 Replace toothbrush
 Buy towels
That should do it
 Just enough to convince Patrice that he was a regular human being and not a man who had given up on life
 It didn’t take much
 Then he could send her a text
 invite her round for dinner while she was in Fairhaven
Flowers
 Why not
 Go crazy
Chris switches on his computer and waits for his emails to load
 A bad habit
 checking in before bedtime
 Delaying bedtime
 usually
 Three new emails
 nothing that looked like it would detain him
 One of his sergeants was doing a triathlon
 a cry for help
 for which he expected to be sponsored
 An invitation to the Kent Police Community Awards night
 bring a guest
 Would that count as a date
 Probably not
 he would check with Donna
 Then an email from an account Chris didn’t recognize
 Didn’t happen often
 Chris kept his personal account as private as one could these days
 From ‘KypriosLegal’
 subject
 ‘Strictly Private and Confidential’
From Cyprus
 Had they found Gianni
 Were solicitors warning the police off
 But why would it come to his personal account
 No one in Cyprus had this email address
Chris clicks on the email
Dear Sir
Our client
 Mr Costas Gunduz
 has asked us to forward this correspondence to you
 Please be advised that all and any information included in this correspondence is to be treated as confidential
 Please direct any reply to our offices
Your faithful servant
Gregory Ioannidis
Kyprios Associates
Costas Gunduz
 Costas who had laughed when Chris had handed him his card
 Well
 wasn’t this turning into quite the evening
 Chris clicks on the attachment
Mr Hudson
You say my son came back to Cyprus in 2000
 You have proof of this
 I need to tell you that I did not see him then and have not seen him since
 Not once
 I have not seen my son
 I have had no letter or no call from my son
Mr Hudson
 I am old
 you have seen this with your own eyes
 As you look for Gianni
 you must know that I too look for him
I will never speak to a police officer
 you understand
 but I ask for help today
 If you can find Gianni
 if you have information of any type
 there is great
 great reward for you
 I fear Gianni is dead
He is my son and I want to see him before I die
 or to know this is impossible and be allowed to grieve
 I hope you accept this with compassion
 I am asking you please
Greetings
Costas Gunduz
Chris reads it through a couple more times
 Nice try
 Costas
 Is he expecting Chris to share this with the Cypriot police
 With Joe Kyprianou
 Surely he is
 Does this mean the Cypriot police are getting close to Gianni
 One last effort to throw them off the scent
Or is it what it says it is
 A plea from an old man to find his missing son
 In his younger days
 Chris might have believed this
 But he’s seen too much
 heard too much from people saving their own skins
 Any story
 And he knows where Gianni Gunduz was on 17 June
Gianni is not dead
 Gianni went home
 with Tony Curran’s money
 He changed his name
 got a nose job and whatever else his dad’s money would pay for and has been living it up ever since
 Gianni is sunning himself somewhere in Cyprus
 happy with his lot
 Without an enemy in the world
 now that Tony Curran has been dealt with
Costas Gunduz will not be getting a reply
Chris shuts down his computer
 He really wishes people would stop doing triathlons
114
Elizabeth is out late
 but Bogdan and Stephen have not noticed
Bogdan has his lower lip jutting out to one side as he thinks
 He taps on the table
 thinking about the right move
 He stares across at Stephen
 then back down at the board
 How does this man play like this
 If Bogdan isn’t very
 very careful he is going to lose
 And Bogdan doesn’t remember the last time he lost
‘Bogdan
 can I ask you a question
’ says Stephen
‘Always
’ says Bogdan
 ‘We are friends
’
‘It won’t put you off
 I have you in a bind here
 I wonder if you need to concentrate
’
‘Stephen
 we play
 we talk
 They are both special to me
’ Bogdan moves his bishop
 He looks up at Stephen
 who is surprised at the move
 but not yet concerned
‘Thank you
 Bogdan
 they are both special to me too
’
‘So
 ask me a good question
’
‘It’s only this
 Well
 firstly
 what was the name of the chap
’ Stephen attacks Bogdan’s bishop
 but senses he is being lured into something
‘Which chap
 Stephen
’ asks Bogdan
 looking down at the board
 grateful for the chink of light which has just appeared
‘The first one who was killed
 The builder
’
‘Tony
’ says Bogdan
 ‘Tony Curran
’
‘That’s the one
’ says Stephen
 He rubs his chin as Bogdan protects his bishop and opens the board at the same time
‘What’s the question
’ asks Bogdan
‘Well
 it’s just this
 and forgive me if I’m speaking out of turn
 but from everything I hear about it
 I think you killed him
 Elizabeth talks to me
 you know
’ Stephen moves a pawn
 but can see there’s nothing much doing
Bogdan looks around the room for a moment
 then back at Stephen
‘Sure
 I killed him
 It’s a secret though
 only one other person knows
’
‘Oh mum’s the word
 old boy
 no one will hear it from me
 But I don’t really understand why
 Not money
 surely
 that doesn’t seem your style at all
’
‘No
 not money
 You got to be careful with money
 Don’t let it be in charge
’ Bogdan advances a knight and Stephen sees what he’s up to at last
 Delightful
 really
‘What was it then
’
‘It was simple
 honestly
 I had a friend
 my best friend when I arrived in England and he drove a taxi
 One day he saw Tony do something he shouldn’t
’
‘What did he see
’ Stephen surprises Bogdan by moving his rook
 Bogdan smiles a little
 He loves this crafty old man
‘He saw Tony shoot a boy
 a young boy from London
 About something
 I don’t know
 I never found out
 A drug thing
’
‘So Tony killed your friend
’
‘Well
 the taxi company is run by a man named Gianni
 They called him Turkish Gianni
 but he was Cypriot
 Gianni and Tony were in business
 but Tony was the boss
’ Bogdan stares down at the board
 taking his time
‘So Gianni killed your friend
’
‘Gianni killed my friend
 but Tony told him to
 I don’t care
 is same thing
’
‘It is
 We’re agreed there
 And whatever happened to Gianni
’
Bogdan feels the need to withdraw his knight
 A waste of a move
 but never mind
 these things happen
‘I kill him too
 Straight away
 pretty much
’
Stephen nods
 He stares at the board in silence for a while
 Bogdan thinks he may have lost him
 but he has learned you have to be patient with Stephen sometimes
 And sure enough
‘What was your friend’s name
’ Stephen keeps looking at the board
 trying to conjure something from nothing
‘Kaz
 Kazimir
’ says Bogdan
 ‘Gianni
 he ask Kaz to drive him to the woods
 he has to bury something and he needs help
 They walk into the woods
 they dig and dig
 for whatever Gianni needs to bury
 He was a hard worker
 Kaz
 and nice
 you would like him very much
 So then Gianni shoot Kaz
 pop
 one shot and buries him in the hole
’
Stephen further advances his pawn
 Bogdan glances up at him and gives him a little nod and a smile
 He scrunches his nose for a moment as he looks back at the board
‘I thought Kaz had run away
 maybe home
 keep his head down
 OK
 But Gianni is stupid
 not like Tony
 and he speaks with his friends and says he shot this guy in the woods and the guy did all the digging
 and isn’t this funny
 And I hear about this
’
‘So you go into action
’ asks Stephen
Bogdan nods
 and wonders about his bishop and whether Stephen might just have something up his sleeve
 ‘I tell Gianni I need to speak to him
 Don’t tell Tony
 don’t tell the others
 I say a friend works in Newhaven
 at the port
 and there might be some money for him
 and is he interested
 And he’s interested
 so we meet at the port
 about two a
m
’
‘And there’s no security
’
‘There’s security
 but the security man is a cousin of my friend
 Steve Georgiou
 A good guy
 He really does work at the port
 Is easier to lie with the truth
 So Steve comes along too
 Steve knew Kaz
 Steve liked Kaz like I did
 So we walk across to harbour steps and get in a little boat and Gianni
 he is stupid
 he just think about money
 and we chug
 chug
 chug
 and it’s choppy and I’m telling him the plan and we use this boat to smuggle people and Steve’s cousin will turn a blind eye and think of all the money
 Then I take out a gun and I tell him kneel down
 which Gianni thinks is a joke
 and I say you killed Kazimir
 just so he knows why he’s there
 so suddenly he thinks it’s not joke
 and I shoot him
’
Bogdan finally moves his bishop and it is Stephen’s turn to scrunch his nose
‘I take his keys and his cards
 We weigh him down with bricks and throw him over
 never to be seen
 Back we go to Newhaven
 we say thank you to Steve’s cousin
 let’s not speak of this
 Then me and Steve
 we drive to Gianni’s house
 we let ourselves in
 we take his passport
 we pack suitcase full of clothes
 there is piles of money
 you know
 drugs money
 and we take this too
 and anything valuable we find
 Some of the money is Tony’s
 like a lot
 so I was glad to take it
’
‘How much money
’ asks Stephen
‘It was like hundred grand
 I send fifty grand to Kazimir’s family
’
‘Good lad
’
‘The rest I give to Steve
 He wanted to open a gym and I thought was good investment
 He’s a good guy
 no nonsense with him
 Then I drive Steve to Gatwick
 he take flight to Cyprus on Gianni’s passport
 no one looks
 Easy
 Then Steve fly straight back to England on his own passport
 I call the police
 anonymous
 but I know enough that they take me serious
 I tell them Gianni killed Kaz
 and they raid his house
’
‘And they find his passport gone and his clothes gone
’
‘Exactly
’
‘So they check the ports and airports and find he’s scarpered off to Cyprus
’ Stephen attacks Bogdan’s bishop with a pawn
 Just as Bogdan had hoped
‘And so they check and check for Gianni for a bit in Cyprus
 but he’s disappeared
 and they just leave to Cypriot police in the end
 No evidence that Gianni killed anyone
 no drug money in his house
 so everyone just forget in the end
 Just move on
’
‘Took your time with Curran though
 eh
’
‘Always just waiting for the best time
 Just planning
 I didn’t want to get caught
 you know
’
‘I should think that would be the last thing you’d want
 yes
’ says Stephen
‘Anyway
 couple of months ago I installed his surveillance system
 the cameras
 the alarm system
 all of this
 And I fitted the whole thing wrong pretty much
 Nothing recording
’
‘I see
’
‘And I thought
 so
 now is the time
 I can get in house
 I got keys made
 no one can see me
’ Bogdan attacks Stephen’s pawn
 opening up a front that Stephen does not want opened up
Stephen nods
 ‘Clever
’
‘Just after I did it there’s a ring
 ring
 ring at the door
 but I stayed pretty calm
 no worry
’
Stephen nods again and moves a pawn in quiet desperation
 ‘Good for you
 What if they catch you
’
Bogdan shrugs
 ‘I don’t know
 I don’t think they will
’
‘Elizabeth will work it out
 old boy
 If she hasn’t already
’
‘I know
 but I think she will understand
’
‘I do too
’ agrees Stephen
 ‘But the police would be a different matter
 They are less easy to charm than Elizabeth
’
Bogdan nods
 ‘If they catch me
 they catch me
 But I laid a pretty good false trail
 I think
’
‘A false trail
 And how did you do that
’
‘Well
 when we went to Gianni’s house on that night
 one of the things we took was a camera
 so –’
Bogdan breaks off as they hear a key turn in the door
 Elizabeth back late from something or other
 Bogdan puts a finger to his lips and Stephen does the same in response
 She walks in
‘Hello
 boys
’ She kisses Bogdan on the cheek and then holds Stephen in a tight embrace
 As she does
 Bogdan moves his queen and closes his trap
‘Checkmate
’
Elizabeth lets Stephen go and he smiles at the board and at Bogdan
 He reaches out and shakes his hand
‘He’s a crafty bugger
 this one
 Elizabeth
 A grade-A crafty bugger
’
Elizabeth looks down at the board
 ‘Well played
 Bogdan
’
‘Thank you
’ says Bogdan
 and starts to set the pieces back up again
‘Well
 I have quite a story for you both
’ says Elizabeth
 ‘Can I make you a cup of tea
 Bogdan
’
‘Yes please
’ says Bogdan
 ‘Milk
 six sugars
’
‘A coffee for me
 love
’ says Stephen
 ‘If it’s not too much trouble
’
Elizabeth walks into the kitchen
 She thinks about Penny
 surely dead by now
 That was how it ended
 in an act of love
 Then she thinks about John
 settling down to a final sleep
 He had taken care of Penny
 but at what cost
 Is he at peace
 Is he out of his misery
 She thinks of Annie Madeley and everything she has missed
 Everyone has to leave the game
 Once you’re in
 there is no other door but the exit
 She reaches for Stephen’s temazepam
 then pauses and puts them back in the cupboard
Elizabeth walks back to her husband
 She takes his hand in hers and kisses him on the lips
 ‘I think it might be time to cut down on the coffee
 Stephen
 All that caffeine
 It can’t be good for you
’
‘Quite so
’ says Stephen
 ‘Whatever you think is for the best
’
Stephen and Bogdan begin another game
 Elizabeth turns back to the kitchen and neither man sees her tears
115
Joyce
Sorry I haven’t written for a while
 it’s been very busy around here
 But I have a gooseberry crumble on the go and I thought there might be a few things you’d want to know
They buried Penny and John the Tuesday before last
 It was quite a quiet one
 and it rained
 which seemed about right
 There were a few old colleagues of Penny’s there
 In fact
 more than you would think
 considering
 It had been in the papers
 Penny and John
 They hadn’t got the whole story straight
 but they were near enough
 The news had got wind that Penny was a friend of Ron
 too
 He was interviewed on Kent Today and they even showed it on the normal news later
 Someone came down from the Sun to talk to him
 but Ron was having none of that
 He told them to park outside Larkin Court and then had them clamped
Elizabeth wasn’t at the funeral
 We haven’t discussed it
 so that’s that
 I’m afraid
 I wonder if she had already said her goodbyes
 She must have
 mustn’t she
I don’t even know if Elizabeth has forgiven Penny
 I’m afraid I take the Old Testament view that what Penny did was right
 That’s just me
 and it’s not something I would say out loud
 but I’m glad she did what she did
 I hope Peter Mercer was alive long enough to know what was happening to him
Elizabeth is a good deal cleverer than me
 and will have thought about it more
 but I can’t see that she could really blame Penny for what she did
 Would Elizabeth have done the same
 I think so
 I think Elizabeth would have got away with it though
But I do think Elizabeth must be sad at the secret
 There were the two girls
 Elizabeth and Penny
 and their mysteries
 and all the while Penny was the biggest mystery of all
 That must hurt Elizabeth
 Perhaps one day we’ll talk about it
Penny killed Peter Mercer and she kept it from John all her life
 Until dementia broke her
 And once John knew
 he had to protect her
 That’s love
 isn’t it
 That’s what Gerry would have done for me
 Because Peter Mercer murdered Annie Madeley
 Penny murdered Peter Mercer
 Because Penny murdered Peter Mercer
 John murdered Ian Ventham
 So it goes
 I suppose
 And at least now it’s done
 I wish peace on Penny and John
 and I wish peace on poor Annie Madeley
 For Peter Mercer
 and for everything he caused
 I wish nothing but torment
The police have yet to find Turkish Gianni by the way
 but they’re looking
 Chris and Donna have popped over here a couple of times
 Chris has a new lady friend
 but is being coy about it for now
 and we can’t get Donna to talk
 Chris says they’ll catch up with Gianni eventually
 but Bogdan was round to fix my power shower the other day and he says Gianni is too smart for that
If you really want my view
 Gianni is far too convenient
 Gianni came over and killed Tony for informing on him all those years ago
 Why would Tony have informed on him
 For his part in clearing up a murder that Tony committed
 That makes no sense to me
No
 the only person too smart to be caught around here is Bogdan
Don’t you think he killed Tony Curran
 I do
 I’m sure he had a good reason
 and I look forward to asking him
 But not until he’s fitted my new replacement window
 because what if he takes offence
 I wonder if Elizabeth suspects him too
 She certainly hasn’t mentioned chasing down Gianni recently
 so perhaps she does
I will have to check the crumble in a bit
 Shall we get on to more pleasant tidings
Hillcrest is already up and running
 there are cranes and diggers up on the hill
 They say Gordon Playfair got £4
2m for his land
 and by ‘they’ I mean Elizabeth
 so you can take it as gospel
 He said goodbye to the house he’d lived in for seventy years and packed his belongings into a Land Rover and trailer
 Then he drove the 400-odd yards down the hill and unpacked it all at a nice two-bed in Larkin Court
Bramley Holdings gave him the flat as part of the deal
 Which brings us on to another bit of news
‘Bramley Holdings’
 It wasn’t about apples
 after all
 I told you
 though
 that the name had rung a bell
 Well
 here’s why
When she was very small
 Joanna had a little toy elephant
 pink with white ears
 and she would never let me wash it
 I can’t imagine the germs it carried
 but I think that’s not necessarily a bad thing with children
 And the name of that elephant
 Bramley
 I had quite forgotten
 She had so many toys and I’m a terrible mother
Perhaps you see where this is going
 though
You remember we had taken Ventham’s accounts to Joanna
 of course
 back when Elizabeth wondered if Ian Ventham had murdered Tony Curran
Anyway
 Joanna and Cornelius had looked through the accounts for us and they’d reported back
 and that was the end of the matter
But for Joanna it hadn’t been the end of the matter at all
 Not a bit of it
Joanna and Cornelius had liked what they saw in the accounts
 And they had liked what they read about Hillcrest
 So Joanna had made a presentation to the other board members – this scene
 in my head
 is around the aeroplane-wing table – and then they bought the company
 She was planning to buy it from Ian Ventham
 but
 of course
 ended up buying it from Gemma Ventham
 So isn’t that a turn-up
Joanna owns the whole place
 Or Joanna’s company
 but that’s the same thing
 isn’t it
Now
 this leads me on to Bernard
 and you’ll see why
Joanna and I had never talked about Bernard
 but she came down to be with me at the funeral
 so had Elizabeth told her perhaps
 Or did she just know
 I think she just knew
 So she came down and she held my hand
 and in a weaker moment I put my head on her shoulder and that was nice
 After the funeral she told me about Bramley Holdings
 I pretended I had known all along
 because I felt guilty about forgetting the elephant
 but Joanna sees straight through me
But we talked
 and I told her I didn’t think this was the sort of business they bought
 and she agreed
 but said it was ‘a sector we have been keen to get into’
 but I see straight through her too and she admitted that was a lie
 She did say there was plenty of money to be made
 but she told me she had another reason too
 Which I’ll tell you now
She sat on the lounger that she bought me
 that would have been a tenth the price in IKEA
 right beside the laptop she bought me that will never be carried anywhere
 and here is what she said
‘Remember when you moved in here
 and I told you it was a mistake
 I told you it would be the end of you
 Sitting in your chair
 surrounded by other people just waiting out their days
 I was wrong
 It was the beginning of you
 Mum
 I thought I would never see you happy again after Dad died
’
(We had never talked about this
 Both our faults
)
‘Your eyes are alive
 your laugh is back and it’s thanks to Coopers Chase and to Elizabeth and to Ron and Ibrahim and to Bernard
 God rest his soul
 And so I bought it
 the company
 the land
 the whole development
 And I bought it to say thank you
 Mum
 Though I know what you’re going to say next
 and I promise I will also make millions out of it
 so don’t panic
’
Well
 I wasn’t panicking
 but that was what I was going to say next
And so a couple of things you will want to know
 The Garden of Eternal Rest is staying exactly where it is
 Joanna says they’ll make quite enough money out of Hillcrest
 so The Woodlands has been quietly shelved
 The graveyard is now protected
 even if Coopers Chase is sold again (Joanna says they will sell it again one day
 that’s their job)
 But just you try and buy it
 you’ll see there are all sorts of covenants in place
 It’s going nowhere
By the way
 Just now
 when I said it was both our faults that we hadn’t talked about Gerry
 Of course it wasn’t both our faults
 It was my fault
 Sorry
 Joanna
We had a ceremony the other day
 Elizabeth invited Matthew Mackie for lunch and along he came
 no dog collar this time
 We broke the news to him that Maggie was safe and I thought he would cry
 but he didn’t
 he just asked to visit the grave
 We walked up the hill with him
 then we sat on Bernard and Asima’s bench while he pushed open the iron gates and knelt beside the grave
 This is when the tears came
 as we knew they would when he saw the headstone
I had watched a couple of days ago as Bogdan had spent the best part of the morning gently cleaning up the inscription ‘Margaret Farrell
 1948–1971’
 before carving underneath
 ‘Patrick
 1971’
 There really is nothing Bogdan can’t do
When Father Mackie broke down at this
 we sent Ron to hold him and the two of them stayed there quite some while
 Elizabeth
 Ibrahim and I stayed on the bench and took in the view
 I like it when men cry
 Not too much
 but this was just right
There are always plenty of flowers on Maggie’s grave now
 I have added some of my own
 and I’m sure you can guess where I got them from
You’ll want to know about the bench
 too
 Well
 busy Bogdan took to the concrete with a pneumatic drill
 then dug down until he found the tiger tea caddy
 which he gave to me
In Bernard’s final letter there was rather a moving postscript
 in which he had asked that his ashes be scattered off the pier in Fairhaven
 I have it here
‘Part of me and part of Asima will always be together
 right here
 But she is floating free in holy waters
 so let me drift on the tide until one day I find her again
’ he had said
 Very poetic Bernard
 I’m sure
Too poetic
You and I know Bernard well enough to know that this was sentimental bunk
 It was a message to me and it wasn’t exactly the Enigma code
 I wonder if Bernard might have thought I was a little thick
 but I suppose he wanted it spelled out
 just in case
 Anyway
 I knew Bernard had given me my instructions
Sufi and Majid had stayed at an airport hotel after the funeral
 because that’s their way
 and I had offered to keep Bernard’s ashes safe until they headed down to Fairhaven
 When will these two learn
I had Asima’s ashes in the tea caddy and I had Bernard’s ashes in a simple wooden urn
 I took out my scales
 Proper ones
 because I don’t trust the electronic ones
I was very careful tipping out the ashes
 because
 much as I liked Bernard
 I didn’t want him all over my worktop
 Within minutes
 and with the help of a couple of intermediary bits of Tupperware (I felt a bit guilty about that) the deed was done
In the tiger tea caddy that they had both wanted to buy the other for Christmas was half Bernard and half Asima
 The next day we buried the tea caddy back under the bench where it belonged
 We asked Matthew Mackie to bless the site and I think he was touched to be asked and did a lovely job
And in the urn
 half Asima and half Bernard
 And
 unbeknownst to them
 that’s what Sufi and Majid took to Fairhaven the following day
 so Asima could finally float free
 but still in the embrace of the man she loved
 We didn’t join them
 as we didn’t really want to interfere
I honestly don’t know what to do with the Tupperware I used
 If you’ve used two Tupperware containers to help mix the ashes of a dear friend and a woman he loved
 without letting their children know
 is it more disrespectful to keep them
 or to throw them away
 This is honestly not the sort of thing I had to worry about before I moved to Coopers Chase
 Elizabeth will know what to do
Talking of Elizabeth
 she rang me earlier to tell me that someone had slid a very interesting note under her door
 She wouldn’t say what it was
 but she said she’d have to pay someone a little visit and then she could tell me
 What a tease!
Well
 it is Thursday
 so I must be on my way
 I worried that
 after Penny
 we might stop meeting
 or perhaps it would feel different
 But that’s not really how things work around here
 Life goes on
 until it doesn’t
 The Thursday Murder Club goes on meeting
 mysterious notes are pushed under doors and murderers fit replacement windows
 Long may it continue
After the meeting I will pop over and see how Gordon Playfair is settling in
 Just being a good neighbour
 before you ask
And
 right on time
 there’s my crumble
 I will let you know how everything goes
Acknowledgements
Thank you so much for reading The Thursday Murder Club
 Unless you haven’t read it yet
 and have just turned straight to the acknowledgements
 which I accept is a possibility
 You must live your life as you choose
I first had the idea for The Thursday Murder Club a few years ago
 when I was fortunate enough to visit a retirement community
 full of extraordinary people with extraordinary stories
 and even its very own ‘contemporary upscale restaurant’
 The residents of that retirement village know who they are
 and I thank them for their support
 Don’t get ideas and start murdering each other though
 please
It is hard work writing a novel
 I’m assuming that’s the case for everyone
 although who knows
 Perhaps Salman Rushdie finds it easy
 Either way
 many people have helped me
 knowingly or unknowingly
 along the way
 It is lovely to be able to thank them publicly here
I want
 first of all
 to thank Mark Billingham
 I had wanted to write a novel for a long time
 and over a very nice lunch at Skewd Turkish restaurant in Barnet (delicious
 great value for money
 try the chicken wings) Mark gave me exactly the encouragement I needed
 at exactly the right time
 He also told me there were no rules to writing a crime novel
 and then proceeded to tell me two great rules which I kept in mind throughout the writing of this book
 Anyway
 Mark
 I will be forever grateful
I was secretly squirrelled away for a long time writing The Thursday Murder Club and I want to thank a number of people for encouraging me to not give up during this time
 Thank you to Ramita Navai
 the best friend I could ever wish for
 to Sarah Pinborough for telling me that
 yes
 it is supposed to be this difficult
 to Lucy Prebble for always reminding me to ‘get it done
 and then get it good’
 to Bruce Lloyd for keeping the train on the tracks
 and to Marian Keyes for the kindness and for the candle
Also
 special thanks to Sumudu Jayatilaka for being my first reader
 It will always mean the world to me
There comes a point when a book more or less exists
 and that’s when you need wise and brilliant people around you to make it better
 The few people who saw early drafts of this book
 and are forever sworn to secrecy
 include my wonderfully talented brother
 Mat Osman (author of the brilliant The Ruins
 also out now)
 and my friend Annabel Jones
 who took time out of her ridiculously busy Black Mirror schedule to read the book and provide so many answers I was missing
 Thank you so much
 Annabel
 you should do this for a living
I want to thank the brilliant team at Viking
 most particularly my editor Katy Loftus
 for backing me and supporting me
 and for coming up with so many different
 kind
 ways of saying
 ‘I’m not sure this bit really works
’ And behind every great editor is a great assistant editor
 so thank you from us both to Vikki Moynes
Thank you also to the rest of the team at Viking
 editorial manager Natalie Wall
 the comms team Georgia Taylor
 Ellie Hudson
 Amelia Fairney and Olivia Mead
 who have heard me say ‘well
 maybe’ so many times
 Thank you too to the amazing sales team – Sam Fanaken
 Tineke Mollemans
 Ruth Johnstone
 Kyla Dean
 Rachel Myers and Natasha Lanigan – and to the DeadGood online team
 and Indira Birnie from the Penguin UK website
 A book is such a team effort
 and I couldn’t wish for a better team
I would also like to thank my US editor
 Pamela Dorman
 and her wonderful assistant editor
 Jeramie Orton
 and I apologize once again for making you have to google Ryman’s
 Holland & Barrett and Sainsbury’s ‘Taste the Difference’
 I am also indebted to the thoroughness and forensic creativity of my copy-editor
 Trevor Horwood
 without who I would never know what the days of the week certain dates were in 1971
 Or
 as Trevor would immediately point out
 ‘without whom’
Writing a book is its own reward
 and I was very ready to chalk this whole project up to experience before sending the very first draft to my agent
 Juliet Mushens
 From her very first reply
 however
 things changed and
 thanks to Juliet
 I realized that The Thursday Murder Club might be an actual book
 which actual people might actually read
 Juliet has been a force of nature from the start – brilliant
 creative
 funny and refreshingly unconventional
 I couldn’t have done any of this without her
 Thank you so much
 Juliet
 She is ably supported by the wonderful Liza DeBlock
 who
 given she has to deal with so many important contracts
 is
 refreshingly
 slightly more conventional
I’ll end
 if I may
 with the big guns
Thank you to my mum
 Brenda Osman
 I hope that
 amongst other things
 there is a sense of kindness and justice
 running through The Thursday Murder Club
 and that comes from you
 It comes as well
 of course
 from your parents
 my grandparents
 Fred and Jessie Wright
 much missed but
 I hope
 very present within these pages
 Thank you too to my wonderful auntie
 Jan Wright
 We are a small family
 but I think we pack a punch
And thank you
 finally
 to my children
 Ruby and Sonny
I have no intention of embarrassing you too much
 so I will just tell you how much I love you
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING
